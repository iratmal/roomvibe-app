Message for Replit Agent — Task 5: Studio Frame Library (12 Frame Styles)

Hi again! This task is to expand the Studio “Frame” options from the current simple set (None / Slim / Gallery) into a small but high‑quality frame library.

This must work together with the previous tasks:
- real-size scaling
- frame white-edge fix
- resize with frames enabled
- dynamic current size readout

All behaviors that apply to Slim/Gallery should apply to ALL new frame styles as well.

-----------------------------------
🎯 GOAL
-----------------------------------
Provide approximately 12 distinct, realistic frame styles that artists and galleries can use in the Studio. These should cover:

- basic modern black/white frames
- warm and dark wood options
- subtle metallics
- a floating frame style
- one “mat + frame” combo

We are not trying to simulate hyper-realistic 3D, but the styles should be visually different enough and look clean and professional.

-----------------------------------
1) FRAME OPTIONS – PROPOSED SET
-----------------------------------
Please implement the following frames in the Frame selector.

IMPORTANT:
- Keep “None” as the first option.
- Keep the existing “Slim” and “Gallery” but adapt them to match the descriptions below (in name and style).
- Add the remaining options after them.

For each frame, we list:
- internalId (for code)
- label (what the user sees)
- notes (style, approximate thickness, color/mat info)

You can adjust exact pixel thickness values and hex colors to fit current design, but keep the spirit of each style.

1) internalId: "none"
   label: "None"
   notes: No frame at all. Just the artwork.

2) internalId: "slim-black"
   label: "Slim Black"
   notes: Very thin, modern black frame. Clean 1–2 cm look in real-world scale.

3) internalId: "gallery-white"
   label: "Gallery White"
   notes: Classic gallery-style white frame, slightly thicker (2–3 cm) with no mat.

4) internalId: "warm-oak"
   label: "Warm Oak"
   notes: Medium-thickness warm oak wood, natural light-brown tone. Good for Scandinavian / cozy interiors.

5) internalId: "dark-walnut"
   label: "Dark Walnut"
   notes: Rich dark brown wood, slightly thicker profile. Elegant, more “serious” gallery feel.

6) internalId: "birch-thin"
   label: "Natural Birch Thin"
   notes: Very thin, pale wood frame. Minimal visual weight, good for modern abstractions.

7) internalId: "bold-black"
   label: "Bold Black"
   notes: Thicker black frame than Slim Black. Strong contrast, works well with colorful abstracts and photography.

8) internalId: "soft-white"
   label: "Soft White"
   notes: Thin to medium white frame, less dominant than Gallery White. Versatile for bright, airy interiors.

9) internalId: "brushed-silver"
   label: "Brushed Silver"
   notes: Matte silver/grey metallic look (not shiny chrome). Modern and neutral.

10) internalId: "champagne-gold"
    label: "Champagne Gold"
    notes: Soft warm gold tone, not too yellow. Slightly more “luxury” but still tasteful.

11) internalId: "floating-wood"
    label: "Floating Wood"
    notes: Simulate a floating frame: a thin gap between the artwork and a wooden outer frame.
          - Small visible gap (0.3–0.8 cm equivalent)
          - Frame color similar to Warm Oak or a neutral mid-tone wood.
          - The artwork appears as if it is “floating” inside the frame box.

12) internalId: "black-with-white-mat"
    label: "Black Frame + White Mat"
    notes: Combination:
          - White “mat” area around the artwork
          - Thin black frame on the outside.
          - Mat should be visibly wider than the frame (e.g. mat 4–6 cm, frame 1–2 cm equivalent).
          - Artwork image is slightly reduced inside the mat window.

-----------------------------------
2) UI & INTERACTION
-----------------------------------
- Show these options as buttons or chips in the Frame section (similar to current None / Slim / Gallery).
- Only ONE frame can be active at a time.
- When a new frame is selected:
  - Apply that frame style to the artwork immediately.
  - Keep artwork position and current size unchanged (no jumping if possible).

- All frames must:
  - respect the white-edge fix (no background gaps)
  - scale correctly when the artwork is resized or when real-size is applied
  - be compatible with drag & resize interactions.

-----------------------------------
3) TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION SUGGESTIONS
-----------------------------------
Depending on the current codebase, you can:

- Use a frameStyle config object with:
  - borderWidth
  - borderColor
  - matWidth (if any)
  - gapWidth (for floating)
  - backgroundColor (for mat)
  - optional special flags (e.g. isFloating = true)

- Render the frame as:
  - one or more nested divs around the artwork image
  - using CSS border and padding to simulate frame/mat/gap

Important:
- Keep performance good and avoid excessive re-renders.
- Ensure mobile and desktop behave consistently.

-----------------------------------
4) COMPATIBILITY WITH PREVIOUS TASKS
-----------------------------------
This frame library must remain compatible with:

- Real-size scaling
- Dynamic “Current size” readout
- Resizing from 4 corners
- Pinch-zoom on mobile
- White-edges fix
- Ability to resize even when a frame is active

If any of the previous behaviors break, please adjust the implementation so that:
- All frames behave like Slim/Gallery do after the previous tasks are completed.

-----------------------------------
✅ FINAL EXPECTATION
-----------------------------------
After this task:

- The Frame section in Studio offers:
  - None
  - Slim Black
  - Gallery White
  - Warm Oak
  - Dark Walnut
  - Natural Birch Thin
  - Bold Black
  - Soft White
  - Brushed Silver
  - Champagne Gold
  - Floating Wood
  - Black Frame + White Mat

- Users can switch between these styles easily.
- Frames look visually distinct and professional.
- Frames work seamlessly with drag, resize, real-size scaling, and “View & Buy”.

Thank you!
