1. Remove old right-side hero card

Please completely remove the existing right-hand hero card (the one with the artwork and sofa from the previous layout).
The hero section must now be a full-width background image with text on the left.

2. Add new full-width hero background image

Please replace the entire hero section background with this image:

📎 hero.png
(You can upload this file now.)

Instructions:

The image should span edge-to-edge full width of the browser window.

No margins, no padding on the sides.

Height should adapt responsively but keep the artwork + sofa fully visible on desktop.

On mobile: crop vertically but keep the artwork and sofa recognizable.

3. Update hero headline and subtitle

Replace all hero text with the following:

Headline:

See Art in Your Space. Instantly.

Subtitle:

Preview any artwork on any wall in seconds, with one simple upload.

Formatting:

Headline color: #0B1F2A

Subtitle color: #0B1F2A at 85% opacity (to improve readability and reduce glare)

Increase line-height slightly for both headline and subtitle for premium spacing.

4. Improve text readability on hero background

To ensure that text stands out clearly on the new full-width image, add:

a very soft, subtle white-to-transparent gradient behind the text (left side only)
OR

increase text shadow / contrast minimally.

Important:
This must be extremely subtle.
We want the hero to look clean and premium — NOT washed out or greyed.

5. Update buttons

Leave the two CTA buttons but ensure:

Start Free button uses the primary RoomVibe color #264C61

Hover state is the existing darker shade

Buttons spacing remains consistent with the new layout

Buttons should sit slightly lower so they align visually with the sofa

6. Layout spacing adjustments

Move hero text block slightly higher (~40px) so the composition breathes better.

Ensure the artwork in the hero background appears perfectly centered above the sofa (as in the hero.png image).

Maintain at least 15% vertical breathing room on top and bottom.

7. Mobile responsiveness

On mobile:

Background image should center around the sofa + artwork.

Text block should remain above the fold.

Buttons should stack vertically.

Maintain readability and spacing.

8. Use Fast Mode & confirm when done

After completing the update, please show me a preview of the updated homepage hero section.
