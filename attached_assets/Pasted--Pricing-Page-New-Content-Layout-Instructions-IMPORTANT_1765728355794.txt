## HOW TO DESIGN THE PRICING SECTION (READ FIRST)

### Overall layout logic

1. **First section = Plan Cards (primary decision layer)**

   * This section explains *what the user gets* in simple, human language.
   * Cards should be easy to read, balanced in height, and not text-heavy.
   * This section is written for **non-technical users** (including elderly artists).

2. **Second section = Feature Comparison Table (confirmation layer)**

   * This section is for users who want details.
   * Use checkmarks / dashes only.
   * No long explanations here.

### Rules for Plan Cards

* Maximum **5–6 bullet points** per card
* One idea per bullet
* Plain English (no technical jargon)
* Focus on outcomes, not features
* Each card ends with **one clear CTA button**
