Goal:
Fix the regression in the artwork image upload: uploading an artwork now fails with the error
“Failed to upload image, please ensure object storage is configured.”
For the current MVP we simply need image upload to work in the current Replit environment, whether using local storage or already-configured storage – without blocking on missing object storage.

Current problem (from user perspective):

Previously, I was able to upload artworks (even though there were some issues with the image display).

After the recent changes related to image handling, when I try to upload a new artwork from the Artist dashboard, the upload fails with:
“Failed to upload image, please ensure object storage is configured.”

As a result, I cannot upload any artworks at all.

What you should do (scope):

Identify the recent changes that introduced the “object storage” requirement or this specific error message.

Search for code paths mentioning object storage, Failed to upload image, or similar.

Adjust the upload logic so that in the current environment (Replit) the artwork upload works even if external object storage is not configured:

Either by using existing local file storage,

or by making object storage optional with a sensible fallback.

Ensure that:

When I upload an artwork with an image, the request succeeds (no error message),

The artwork record is saved (title, size, price, etc.),

The image is stored somewhere that the app can read from,

The image URL/path is saved in the artwork record.

Keep the previous fixes intact:

After a full page refresh, the artwork still appears in the Artist dashboard list with its image thumbnail,

“View in your room” / Studio still opens and uses the correct artwork.

Test end-to-end:

Upload a new artwork with an image from the Artist dashboard,

Confirm there is no “Failed to upload image” error,

Refresh the page and verify the artwork (including image) is visible,

Open the Studio / “See in your room” for that artwork and verify the image is displayed on the canvas.

Important constraints (DO NOT):

Do not require setting up external object storage just to make the MVP work. It must work in the current Replit setup.

Do not change Stripe, GA4, auth, or other unrelated systems.

Do not refactor large parts of the upload pipeline – focus on fixing this regression and making upload reliable.

Stop condition:

I can successfully upload a new artwork with an image from the Artist dashboard without any error,

After refresh, the artwork with its image is visible in the dashboard,

The same artwork’s image is correctly shown in the Studio / “View in your room”.
