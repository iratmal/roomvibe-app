Goal:
Fix the Shopify Artwork Widget so that when a customer clicks “View in your room” on a product page:

the RoomVibe Studio opens with that specific artwork preselected (not always “Light My Fire”), and

the Studio opens in “Upload your room” mode by default (no preset room selected; user is invited to upload their own wall).

Current behavior (problem):

I have an artwork (e.g. “Rose Gold”) in my Artist dashboard with a working Get Widget Code and Buy URL.

I paste the widget code into a Shopify product.

On the product page I see the purple button “See / View in your room” and it opens the Studio correctly.

BUT:

The Studio always opens with the same default artwork (“Light My Fire”) instead of the artwork that belongs to that widget/product.

The Studio opens in Room 1 preset scene with the sofa, instead of focusing on uploading the customer’s wall photo.

What you should do (scope):

Artwork selection from widget

Inspect the current Artwork Widget Code that is shown in the Artist dashboard (“Get Widget Code”).

Ensure that the embed code includes a unique identifier for the specific artwork (e.g. artworkId).

Ensure that when the widget opens the Studio (in an iframe/modal), the Studio URL includes that identifier, e.g.:

...?artworkId=<id of that artwork>

In the Studio front-end, on initial load:

read the artworkId from the URL,

find the matching artwork in the loaded catalogue,

set it as the initially selected artwork.

If artworkId is missing → keep the current default behavior.

Default “Upload your room” mode for widget entry

For Studio sessions that are opened from the external widget (Shopify), change the initial view so that:

the main canvas is empty / neutral (no preset room image),

the UI clearly highlights the “Upload wall photo” action (same effect as if the user manually clicked that button),

preset Rooms (Room 1–10) can i dalje ostati dostupni sa strane, ali nijedan nije automatski aktivan.

One simple way is to:

add a query param like entry=widget or mode=upload,

on Studio init, if mode=upload → skip selecting a preset scene and show the upload state instead.

End-to-end testing

In the Artist dashboard, create at least two different artworks and generate a widget code for each.

Embed each widget into a different test product in Shopify.

For each product:

open the page, click “View in your room”,

confirm that the Studio opens with that specific artwork preselected,

confirm that the Studio opens in upload mode (no Room 1 background; user is prompted to upload their wall).

Verify that existing behavior inside the Studio (changing rooms, frames, etc.) still works normally after the initial state.

Important constraints (DO NOT):

Do not implement a full multi-artist marketplace in this task – this is only about mapping an artwork to its widget and adjusting the initial Studio state.

Do not change Stripe, GA4, auth, or other unrelated systems.

Do not refactor large parts of the app; limit changes to:

widget embed generation,

widget → Studio URL parameters,

Studio initialization logic for artwork selection + initial scene.

Stop condition:

On Shopify, when I click “View in your room” on a product tied to artwork X, the Studio opens:

with artwork X already selected, and

in “Upload your room” mode (blank canvas / upload focus), not with Room 1 preset background.
