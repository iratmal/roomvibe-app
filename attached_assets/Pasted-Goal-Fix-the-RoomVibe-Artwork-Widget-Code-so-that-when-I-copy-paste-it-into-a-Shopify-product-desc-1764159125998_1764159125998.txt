Goal:
Fix the RoomVibe Artwork Widget Code so that, when I copy/paste it into a Shopify product description (HTML mode), the widget is actually rendered and visible on the product page (e.g. a “See in your room” button or embedded component).
Right now, nothing is displayed on the Shopify product page.

Context:

Project: RoomVibe

In the Artist / Admin interface there is an “Artwork Widget Code” for each artwork.

I copied that embed code and pasted it into a Shopify product description (using the HTML editor <>).

The product page loads, but no widget appears at all (no button, no iframe, no visible element).

I don’t see any obvious error on the page, just “nothing happens”.

What you should do (scope):

Locate the code that generates the Artwork Widget embed snippet

Search for things like: widget, embed code, Artwork Widget Code, see in your room, script src, etc.

Identify the exact HTML/JS snippet we are giving to users for embedding on external sites (Shopify).

Verify that the embed snippet works in a simple static HTML file

Create a minimal HTML test page in the project (or locally in the Replit environment) that only contains the widget embed code.

Open it and confirm that the widget actually renders (e.g. shows a button / UI to open the RoomVibe view for that artwork).

If it does NOT render, fix the snippet and/or the widget initialization logic until it works in this simple static HTML scenario.

Make the embed snippet robust for external sites like Shopify

The snippet must work when pasted into a generic HTML container on another domain (like Shopify product description).

Typically this means:

loading a single <script src="..."> from RoomVibe (or similar)

and a <div> container with data attributes (e.g. data-artwork-id=...)

plus JavaScript that auto-initializes the widget when the script loads.

Please avoid dependencies on frameworks that won’t exist on external sites (e.g. do not rely on internal React context or bundler-only globals).

Error handling and fail-safe

If the widget cannot load (e.g. network error), the embed should at least show a small fallback message or fail silently but must not break the rest of the page.

Make sure no uncaught JS errors are thrown when the embed code runs on an external page.

Update the Artwork Widget Code that is shown in the RoomVibe admin

Ensure that the embed code we display to Artists is the final, working version (the one you have just tested).

The instructions for the artist should remain simple: “Copy this code and paste it into the HTML of your product page”.

Document how to use it (short)

In the code or comments, briefly note:

where the widget script is hosted

how the embed snippet is structured

how it should be used on external sites.

Important constraints (DO NOT):

Do not change Stripe, GA4, membership, or any unrelated systems.

Do not refactor large parts of the app – only touch the widget embed + widget initialization logic.

Do not build new features – the goal is just to make the existing Artwork Widget Code work reliably when embedded.

Stop condition:

When I copy the Artwork Widget Code from the RoomVibe admin, paste it into a Shopify product description (HTML mode), save the product, and view it on the storefront, the widget is clearly visible and functional (e.g. a “See in your room” button or block appears and works).
