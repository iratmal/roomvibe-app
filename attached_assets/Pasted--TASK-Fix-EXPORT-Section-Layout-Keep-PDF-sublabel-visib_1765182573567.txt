# TASK – Fix EXPORT Section Layout (Keep PDF sublabel visible & align View & Buy button)

**Goal:**
Improve the layout of the **EXPORT** section in the Studio right column so that:

1. The **PDF Export** sublabel ("Printer-ready quality") is always fully visible.
2. The **View & Buy** button is not stuck directly under the PDF Export row, but appears with proper spacing below the upgrade CTA.
3. The entire right column has enough vertical space so the footer does not visually "push" into the Studio controls.
4. Left and right columns visually extend down to a similar height for balance.

This is a follow-up refinement to the Studio layout.

## 1) EXPORT Section – Required Visual Structure

The EXPORT block should follow this vertical order (top to bottom):

1. **Download** button

   * Subtext: "1200 px – watermark on free plan" (or similar)
2. **High-Resolution Download** button

   * Subtext: "3000 px – no watermark – Designer feature"
3. **PDF Export** button

   * Subtext: **"Printer-ready quality"** → this text must be fully visible
4. **Unlock High-Resolution Export – Upgrade** CTA button
5. **View & Buy** button

Each row should have:

* consistent vertical spacing (e.g. margin-bottom),
* no overlapping or collapsing of subtext when viewport height is smaller.

Make sure the PDF export subtext is not covered or visually merged with the View & Buy button.

---

## 2) Fix View & Buy Button Position

Currently, the **View & Buy** button is visually pushed up so that it appears directly under the PDF Export button, hiding the "Printer-ready quality" label.

Required behaviour:

* Add sufficient margin/padding between the **PDF Export** block and the **Unlock High-Resolution Export → Upgrade** CTA.
* Place **View & Buy** **below** the Upgrade CTA, with the same vertical spacing as other buttons.

Example structure (pseudo):

```tsx
<section className="space-y-3">
  <ExportButtonMain />
  <ExportButtonHighRes />
  <ExportButtonPdf />

  <UpgradeHighResCta />

  <ViewAndBuyButton />
</section>
```

Avoid absolute positioning or negative margins in this section.

## 3) Increase Right Column Height (More Breathing Room)

To prevent the EXPORT block from being squashed against the footer, slightly **increase the effective height** of the Studio area so that the right column has enough vertical space.

Options:

* Increase `min-height` of the main Studio container (`studio-main`) relative to viewport height (e.g. `min-h-[calc(100vh-HEADER-FOOTER_OFFSET_SMALLER)]` → tweak offset so there is more room).
* Alternatively, add more top padding within the right column so elements are not compressed at the bottom.

Goal: On a typical laptop viewport, user should see the entire EXPORT section (including sublabels and both buttons) without it colliding visually with the footer.

---

## 4) Keep Left Column Visually Balanced

Ensure the **left Scenes column** visually extends down to a similar height as the right column, so the layout looks balanced.

* If right column height is increased, mirror the height logic on the left column container.
* Continue using internal scroll (`overflow-y-auto`) for long room lists inside the left column.

---

## 5) Testing

On a typical 13"–15" laptop viewport:

* All three export buttons and their sublabels are fully visible.
* The "Printer-ready quality" text under PDF Export is clearly visible and not overlapped.
* The View & Buy button is clearly separated from the PDF Export row and sits below the upgrade CTA.
* There is visible breathing space between the bottom of the EXPORT section and the footer.
* Left and right columns visually align in height.

---

## Mode

Use **Fast Mode** – small layout and spacing adjustments.

---

## Stop Condition

* PDF Export sublabel is always readable.
* View & Buy button sits in the correct position with proper spacing.
* Studio columns look balanced and not "zgnječeno" u footer.
