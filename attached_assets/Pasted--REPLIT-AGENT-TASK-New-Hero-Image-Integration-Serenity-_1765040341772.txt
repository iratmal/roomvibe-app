✅ REPLIT AGENT TASK — New Hero Image Integration (Serenity Version)

(Fast Mode recommended — small but precise UI task)

Goal:

Implement the new full-width HERO layout using the provided Serenity hero image, with correct spacing for the text on the left, and WITHOUT touching any existing text, copy or buttons.

1️⃣ Replace the HERO background image

Use the supplied image: Serenity_Hero.jpg (the one I will upload right after I send you this task).

The hero must match the proportions of the thumbnail version we liked:

Art on the right side

Couch fully visible

White wall and floor extended significantly to the left for the text block.

Important:
Do NOT darken the image.
Do NOT apply gradients.
Do NOT zoom into the art.
Use the image exactly as supplied.

2️⃣ Layout requirements
Left side (text area)

Keep ALL existing text and CTA buttons exactly as they are.

Do NOT change colors, font size or positioning logic.

Ensure the text sits fully on the white wall area with enough space around it.

Spacing adjustments:

Increase line-height slightly on the headline (See Art in Your Space. Instantly.).

Increase vertical spacing between the headline, subheadline and buttons.

Buttons

Make both buttons slightly larger (padding + font size + border radius untouched).

Keep exact colors from design system.

Ensure labels remain:

Start Free

How It Works (fix if it accidentally reverts to “Watch How It Works”)

3️⃣ Remove unwanted elements

Remove the play button overlay completely from the hero image.

4️⃣ Final image fit

The right side of the image must show the painting, couch, and plant cleanly.

The left side must have extended white wall + floor to support the hero text block.

If necessary, adjust the hero container height so the composition feels balanced, but do not crop the artwork.

5️⃣ Files to Modify

Use @filename targeting for precision:

src/components/Hero.tsx

src/components/HeroImage.tsx (if exists)

src/styles/hero.css or Tailwind classes in the JSX

6️⃣ After implementing:

Please verify:

Hero text does not overlap with the artwork.

Responsive layout works (mobile + tablet + desktop).

Buttons remain horizontally aligned on desktop and stack correctly on mobile.

Image is crisp and not darkened.

✔️ Allowed tools

Fast Mode (recommended)

No design changes besides spacing and hero image fit

Do NOT alter global styles or other components
