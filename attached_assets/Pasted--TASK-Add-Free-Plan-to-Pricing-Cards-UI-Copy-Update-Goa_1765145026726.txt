# TASK – Add Free Plan to Pricing Cards (UI Copy Update)

**Goal:**
Add the new **Free Plan** to the pricing cards on the `/pricing` page and ensure all plans are displayed in correct order:

**Free → Artist → Designer → Gallery → All-Access**

This task updates ONLY the text/content of pricing cards. No logic or Stripe configuration is modified here.

---

# ✅ PART 1 — Add FREE PLAN Pricing Card

Insert a new pricing card at the top of the pricing section.

### **FREE PLAN (0€/mo)**

Replace entire card text with:

* Access to **10 basic mockup rooms**
* Upload up to **3 artworks**
* Basic low‑resolution download export
* Frame styling controls
* Widget embed
* Buy button integration (Shopify, WooCommerce, Wix)
* No premium rooms
* No standard rooms (available in Artist plan)
* No designer tools
* No gallery tools
* No exhibitions

This card must visually match the style of existing pricing cards.

# ✅ PART 2 — Update Pricing Card ORDER

Plans must appear in the following exact sequence:

1. **Free**
2. **Artist**
3. **Designer**
4. **Gallery**
5. **All-Access**

Ensure the UI reflects this order on desktop and mobile.

# ✅ PART 3 — Update ARTIST Plan Text (Fix “30+ rooms”)

Replace text:

* ❌ "Access to 30+ standard mockup rooms"

with:

* ✅ "Access to **up to 30** standard mockup rooms"

Apply this change consistently anywhere Artist plan text appears on the pricing page.
