# TASK – Update Feature Comparison Table (Add Free Plan + Fix Artist Rooms)

**Goal:**
Update the Feature Comparison table on the `/pricing` page to:

1. Add the new **Free Plan** column.
2. Correct the Artist plan rooms from **"30+ rooms"** to **"up to 30 rooms"**.
3. Ensure ALL cells match the new, accurate feature distribution.

This task updates only the **Feature Comparison Table UI**, NOT pricing cards (already updated).

# ✅ PART 4 — Implementation Notes

* Ensure correct column order: **Free → Artist → Designer → Gallery → All-Access**.
* Keep existing checkmark (✔) and dash (—) styles.
* Maintain current table spacing, font sizing, and responsiveness.
* Confirm mobile layout still displays all columns correctly.
* Do NOT modify pricing cards or plan descriptions.

# MODE PREFERENCE

**Fast Mode** — UI table update only.

---

# STOP CONDITION

* Feature Comparison table displays all 5 plans including Free.
* Artist plan shows "up to 30 rooms", not "30+".
* All ticks/dashes perfectly match the table above.
* Mobile and desktop layouts render correctly.
