i! The first version of drag is working, thank you 🙌
Now I’d like to make the Studio editor more flexible and intuitive with two improvements:

1) Extend drag area – artwork should move across the whole wall

Right now the artwork can only move a little bit left/right.
I would like the artwork to be draggable across the entire wall area (the full central scene), not just a small central box.

Please update the drag constraints:

Use the full wall container (the image area where the room/scene is rendered) as the bounding box for offsetX / offsetY.

The user should be able to move the artwork:

left/right all the way to the edges of the visible wall,

up/down much more than now (again, constrained by the wall image, not a tiny central region).

It’s OK to keep a small padding from the absolute edge, but the feeling should be:

“I can place the artwork anywhere on this wall.”

In short: relax the drag limits so the painting can be positioned freely over the wall, not only near the center.

2) Add direct resize handles on the artwork (interactive scaling)

I would like to be able to resize the artwork directly on the canvas, not only by typing Width/Height.

Expected behaviour:

Add a small resize handle (for example in the bottom-right corner of the artwork frame).

Cursor style: se-resize on hover.

On mousedown / touchstart on this handle:

Start a resize operation.

On mousemove / touchmove:

Change the artwork size according to the drag delta (diagonal).

If “Lock ratio” is ON:

keep aspect ratio while resizing

If “Lock ratio” is OFF:

allow free resize (width/height independently) – but if this is too much work, it’s OK to keep lock-ratio only.

On mouseup / touchend:

Finish the resize operation.

Sync with Size controls (true-to-size logic):

The existing Width/Height fields (in cm) and true-to-size scaling should stay the “source of truth”.

When the user drags the resize handle:

update the underlying width/height state that you already use for cm → px conversion,

keep the Width/Height input values in sync (so the numbers change as we resize by handle).

You can reuse the current cm-to-pixels factor you already use in Studio to maintain real-world scaling.

Constraints:

While resizing, keep the artwork inside the wall bounds (don’t allow it to grow outside the visible wall container).

Reset position should not change the size – only position.
(Size is controlled via Width/Height and the new resize handle.)

After implementing:

Please test:

that I can drag the artwork freely across the whole wall area,

that I can resize via the corner handle and the Width/Height fields update accordingly,

that everything still respects the wall bounds and true-to-size logic.

Then run build + deploy and share the updated URL.

Thank you! 🙏
