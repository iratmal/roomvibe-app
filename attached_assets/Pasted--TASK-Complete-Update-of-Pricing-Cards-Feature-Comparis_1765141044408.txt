# 📌 Implementation Notes

* Modify ONLY text/copy inside pricing cards and the comparison table.
* Do not alter card layout, spacing, colors, icons, or grid structure.
* Do not modify any Stripe or billing logic.
* Do not change URLs, CTA buttons, or checkout flows.
* Ensure spacing stays clean and visually aligned after text replacement.

# ✔ Stop Condition

The pricing cards display **exactly** the updated texts above, and the feature comparison table matches the updated version 1:1. No visual or logical inconsistencies remain.

---

# ⚡ Mode Preference

This is a textual UI update → **use Fast Mode if available.**
