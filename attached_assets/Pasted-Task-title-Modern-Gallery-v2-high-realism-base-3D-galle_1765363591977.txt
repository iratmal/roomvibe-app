Task title:
Modern Gallery v2 – high-realism base 3D gallery (Artsteps-style)

Context

We now have a stable baseline where 360 artworks render correctly.

Git tags:

safe-360-stable-frontend-2025-12-10

safe-360-stable-backend-2025-12-10

Feature branch for future 360 work: feature-360-gallery-upgrade.

Important rules

Do all work in branch feature-360-gallery-upgrade, do not break main.

Do not change the 360 Editor UI or the wall slots naming (North Wall – Left/Center/Right, etc.).

360 artwork loading must keep working exactly as now (no black planes again).

1. Goal

Upgrade the existing “Modern Gallery” 360 scene so that it feels much more like a real museum space, visually similar to the Artsteps examples I provided:

large, airy hall

tall white walls

black columns

warm wooden floor

skylight openings on the ceiling

realistic directional lighting and soft shadows

artworks appear at realistic size and height on the walls

This is a visual / realism upgrade only. Navigation stays as it is (current 360 editor with fixed viewpoints). “Street View” walking, comments and music will come later in a separate task.

2. Target look (based on screenshots)

Please use the screenshots I uploaded (Artsteps CBYF Youth Photography Gallery) as visual reference. Translate that into our own neutral, modern RoomVibe style:

Bright, daylight interior with light bouncing from skylights and side windows.

Black structural columns that visually break up the space.

Clean white walls for hanging art.

Light, natural wood floor with subtle variation, not flat color.

Subtle light patches on the floor (from skylights) to create depth.

Track lights / spotlights along the walls above artworks.

We don’t want to copy their gallery 1:1, but the feeling of realism should be comparable.

3. Implementation details

3.1. Files

Find and refactor the code that defines the 3D scene for the Modern Gallery used in the 360 Editor, for example in files like:

src/exhibition360.ts

src/components/Gallery360Scene.tsx

(Names may differ – please locate the actual scene setup used by the “Modern Gallery” preset.)

3.2. Geometry / layout

Keep the same wall slots (North/East/West/South wall, Upper/Lower/Center etc.), but you can slightly reposition them if needed for better composition.

Create a large rectangular hall with:

higher ceiling than now (double-height feel)

4–8 black columns evenly spaced in the central area

optional upper gallery / balcony is fine visually, but it doesn’t need to be reachable yet

Add 2–4 skylight openings in the ceiling (simple rectangular cut-outs) so that we can place directional lights above them.

3.3. Materials

Walls: soft off-white material with very subtle roughness, no shiny plastic look.

Floor: PBR-style wood (or at least a good textured material) with:

slight variation in color

gentle reflections (very low gloss)

Columns: dark grey / black with matte finish.

Frames: thin black or dark grey frames around artworks.

3.4. Lighting

Add a main directional light simulating daylight coming from above (skylights).

Add additional soft fill lights so that no area is completely dark.

Add simple wall spotlights above artworks (can be just small point lights or spotlights near the wall).

Enable soft shadows where possible without killing performance.

Make sure artworks are clearly lit and readable, not washed out, not completely in shadow.

3.5. Artwork placement & scale

Use the existing artwork planes, but:

Adjust their scale so that:

medium artworks feel like ~80–120 cm wide on the wall

they are not tiny in a huge wall

Place centers of artworks roughly at human eye level (around 1.5–1.6 m from “floor” in your coordinate system).

Keep the spacing between artworks similar to a real gallery – not cramped, not too far.

3.6. Camera / 360 viewpoints

Keep the existing 360 navigation logic.

Adjust camera height to feel like a person standing in the space (not too low, not too high).

Ensure that from each default viewpoint you can see at least one nicely lit wall with artwork, similar to the Artsteps examples.

4. Acceptance criteria

This task is done when:

In the 360 Editor, selecting “Modern Gallery” shows:

a large bright hall with white walls, wooden floor, black columns, and visible skylight openings

artworks on the walls at realistic size and height

Lighting feels natural:

no completely flat shading

subtle shadows

artworks are clearly visible and readable

Performance is smooth on a typical laptop (no heavy lag, no WebGL errors in console).

There are no regressions in:

artwork loading (no black planes)

wall slot assignment and naming

saving and re-loading 360 scenes

All changes are committed in branch feature-360-gallery-upgrade with a clear commit message, and the stable tags (safe-360-stable-*) still point to the previous known-good state.
