Task: Fix Classic Gallery 360 scene – artwork scaling & frames (not Modern Gallery)

Context:

* I am using the **Classic Gallery** preset in the 360 Editor.
* **Modern Gallery** preset is currently completely black – I ignore it for now.
* You have removed the yellow selection rectangle – that part works ✅
* However, the other changes you described (real dimensions, stronger scaling, deep frames) are **not visible** in the live app.

What I see right now in Classic Gallery:

* Paintings still look **too small** on the wall.
* Frames look very thin and flat, like stickers, with no real depth.
* Relative sizes are **not correct**:

  * “Mordor Veil” is 100×100 cm.
  * “Red City” and “Harmony” are 150×100 cm.
  * On the wall they do **not** clearly look larger/smaller one compared to another, and not correct compared to the wall size.
* So the behavior you described (using width_cm / height_cm, ARTWORK_GLOBAL_SCALE = 1.6, deeper frames) does **not match** what I see.

I also always deploy from **main**, so the issue is probably **not** deployment, but either:

* Code accidentally applied to **Modern Gallery**, not Classic, or
* The new constants are defined but not actually used for the Classic Gallery artwork meshes.

Please do the following and paste the key code snippets back to me so we can verify:

1. Show current code from `src/components/360/Gallery360Scene.tsx`

Please paste these sections exactly as they are now:

1.1 Definition of artwork scale and frame config

```ts
// Somewhere near the top or before the component
const ARTWORK_GLOBAL_SCALE = ...;

const FRAME_CONFIG = {
  thickness: ...,
  depth: ...,
  color: "...",
  offsetFromWall: ...,
};
```

1.2 Helper that converts artwork cm dimensions to meters and applies scale

```ts
function getArtworkDimensionsMeters(artwork: Artwork) {
  // width_cm, height_cm -> meters -> scaled
}
```

1.3 The part where the geometry for each artwork is created and these dimensions are used

```tsx
<mesh /* artwork plane */>
  <planeGeometry args={[widthMeters, heightMeters]} />
  {/* material / texture here */}
</mesh>
```

If there is a separate component like `<ArtworkFrame />` or `<ArtworkPlane />`, please paste that component as well.

2. Confirm the code is really on `main`

Run these commands in the Replit Shell and paste the outputs:

```bash
cd /home/runner/workspace

git status

git log --oneline -5
```

I always deploy from `main`, so I just want to be sure that the commit
with the new scaling and frame changes is actually on `main`, not only in some other branch.

3. Add a temporary console.log to verify actual sizes per artwork

In the place where you compute the artwork dimensions (inside `getArtworkDimensionsMeters` or just before creating the `<planeGeometry>`), please add this log:

```ts
console.log(
  "[DebugSize]",
  artwork.title,
  "cm:",
  artwork.width_cm,
  "x",
  artwork.height_cm,
  "metersScaled:",
  widthMeters,
  "x",
  heightMeters
);
```

Then:

* Republish from `main` as usual.
* I will refresh the **Classic Gallery** preset and send you a screenshot of the browser console so we can confirm:

  * 100×100 cm → 1.6m × 1.6m
  * 150×100 cm → 2.4m × 1.6m

4. Ensure changes apply specifically to Classic Gallery

If the scene uses different configs for `Classic Gallery` vs `Modern Gallery` (e.g. via presets or conditionals), please check that the **Classic Gallery** preset is also using the updated scaling and frame logic.

For example, if you have something like:

```ts
if (presetId === "classic") {
  // one config
} else if (presetId === "modern") {
  // other config
}
```

please confirm that the classic branch is wired to use:

* `getArtworkDimensionsMeters(artwork)` for geometry
* `FRAME_CONFIG` for frame thickness, depth, offset

Summary of the problem (short):

* Yellow selection rectangle is gone ✅
* But artwork sizes and frames in **Classic Gallery** still look like before ❌
* Relative dimensions between artworks and their size vs wall are not correct ❌
* We need to:

  * Verify the actual code in `Gallery360Scene.tsx` for Classic Gallery.
  * Confirm that code is on `main`.
  * Log calculated sizes for a few artworks to see if scaling is applied correctly.
