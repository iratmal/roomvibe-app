Message for Replit Agent — Task: Add “Change Password” Inside Dashboard

Hi! Here is the next task.

TASK: Add a functional “Change Password” section inside the user dashboard (no email required).

Requirements:
1. Add a “Change Password” component inside the dashboard (User Dashboard for now).
2. Fields required:
   - Current password
   - New password
   - Confirm new password
3. On submit:
   - Validate current password
   - Validate new password length (> 6 chars)
   - Ensure new password and confirm match
4. If current password is correct:
   - Update password in the database (hashed)
   - Return JSON { success: true, message: "Password updated successfully" }
5. If incorrect:
   - Return JSON { success: false, message: "Current password is incorrect" }
6. After success:
   - Show success toast/message
   - Optionally clear the fields

Notes:
- This feature must work only when user is logged in.
- No email or external provider needed.
- Keep code modular so later we can add full “Forgot Password” flow.

Goal:
Allow logged-in users to securely change their password from inside the dashboard.

Thank you!
