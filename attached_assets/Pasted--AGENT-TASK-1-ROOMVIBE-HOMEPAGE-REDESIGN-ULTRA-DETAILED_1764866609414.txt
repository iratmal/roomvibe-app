# AGENT TASK #1 — ROOMVIBE HOMEPAGE REDESIGN (ULTRA-DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION BRIEF)

**Goal:** Fully rebuild the RoomVibe homepage according to the new premium layout, copy, and visual identity. This task covers ONLY the desktop version. Mobile optimizations will follow after we review the desktop output.

* Use **charcoal text (#1A1A1A)** for all body text.
* Use **RoomVibe Navy (#0A1C2F)** for primary CTAs and footer.
* Use **accent gold (#C9A24A)** sparingly for premium details (small icons or underline accents).
* Typography: Inter font family (Bold, SemiBold, Medium, Regular).
* Layout must follow the exact section order and spacing described below.
