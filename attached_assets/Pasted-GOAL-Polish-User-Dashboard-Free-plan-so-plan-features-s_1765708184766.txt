GOAL:
Polish User Dashboard (Free plan) so plan features shown in UI match our Free plan promise,
and user can actually find/understand “Widget embed” + “Buy button integration”.

ENV:
STAGING ONLY
Admin Impersonation -> User
Route: /dashboard/user

SCOPE A — FREE PLAN FEATURE LIST (UI)
Update “Your Plan” card (Free) to show THESE 4 items (at least):
- Up to 3 artworks
- 10 basic mockup rooms
- Widget embed
- Buy button integration

Make sure this list is the same as our pricing/marketing claim for Free.

SCOPE B — ADD 2 NEW SECTIONS ON USER DASHBOARD (MVP, NO COMPLEX FEATURE WORK)

1) Widget Embed (MVP)
Add a section on User dashboard called “Widget Embed”.
It should include:
- short explanation (what it is)
- the public link / embed code the user can copy

MVP rules (keep it simple):
- If user has 0 artworks -> show disabled state + message:
  “Upload at least 1 artwork to enable widget embed.”
- Once user has at least 1 artwork -> show:
  - a copy button for embed code (iframe snippet) OR
  - a copy button for public URL (minimum acceptable)
- Do NOT build a full widget builder. Just expose a working embed/link entry point.

2) Buy Button Integration (clarity)
Add a section called “Buy Button Integration”.
Explain clearly:
- Buy URL is already supported per artwork (field in upload/edit)
- Provide a quick checklist:
  “Add a Buy URL to your artwork to enable the Buy button in Studio/Widget.”
- If possible: show an indicator:
  - “0/0 artworks have a Buy URL” (when none exist)
  - “X/Y artworks have a Buy URL” (when artworks exist)

MVP rules:
- Do NOT build e-commerce integrations.
- This is visibility + guidance + status only.

SCOPE C — PAGE POLISH
- Keep the dashboard layout stable (no redesign).
- Ensure no extra footer jumps or weird spacing.
- Ensure all new sections look consistent with existing cards (same padding, headings, typography).

DO NOT:
- Change backend contracts
- Add new billing logic
- Implement complex widget editor
- Touch other role dashboards

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- Free plan card shows the 4 promised features
- User dashboard includes “Widget Embed” + “Buy Button Integration” sections
- With 0 artworks: widget embed is disabled with clear instruction
- With >=1 artwork: user can copy embed code or at minimum a public URL
- Buy integration section clearly explains Buy URL + shows X/Y coverage
- No console errors
