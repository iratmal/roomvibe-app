Message for Replit Agent — Task: Admin Dashboard + Role Impersonation

Hi! Here is the next task.

TASK: Implement an Admin Dashboard + “View As Role” (impersonation) feature so the admin can switch between User, Artist, Designer, and Gallery dashboards without logging in/out repeatedly.

This will allow the project owner to fully test all roles from one account.

-----------------------------------
ADMIN ACCOUNT SETUP
-----------------------------------
1. Please set the following account as **admin**:
   Email: irena.ratkovicmalbasa@gmail.com
   Role: admin

2. When this admin logs in, they should automatically be redirected to:
   /dashboard/admin

-----------------------------------
ADMIN DASHBOARD REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------
Create a simple Admin Dashboard with:
- Header: “Admin Dashboard”
- Display: admin email + role
- Buttons for impersonation:
    • View as User
    • View as Artist
    • View as Designer
    • View as Gallery
- Button: “Return to Admin Mode”

-----------------------------------
IMPERSONATION LOGIC (“VIEW AS”)
-----------------------------------
When admin clicks a “View as ___” button:

1. DO NOT change the admin’s real role in the database.
2. Instead create a temporary session value:
   impersonatedRole = "user" / "artist" / "designer" / "gallery"

3. Redirect to the corresponding dashboard:
   • User → /dashboard
   • Artist → /dashboard/artist
   • Designer → /dashboard/designer
   • Gallery → /dashboard/gallery

4. UI should show a small banner or message:
   “You are viewing as: [Role] (Admin Impersonation)”
   + a “Return to Admin Mode” button.

5. Clicking “Return to Admin Mode”:
   - Clears impersonatedRole
   - Redirects back to /dashboard/admin

-----------------------------------
ROUTE PROTECTION
-----------------------------------
- Admin can access ALL routes.
- Impersonated routes are allowed only when impersonatedRole is set.
- Normal users/different roles cannot use impersonated routes.

-----------------------------------
GOAL
-----------------------------------
Allow the admin to:
- Log in once
- Click buttons to preview User, Artist, Designer, Gallery dashboards
- Easily return to Admin Dashboard
- Test the full system without multiple accounts or logins

-----------------------------------

Thank you!
