# 🎯 TASK: USER DASHBOARD POLISH (STAGING)

**Scope:** User role only (Free plan)
**Environment:** STAGING ONLY
**Rule:** Do not move to Artist dashboard until this is 100% green

---

## 1️⃣ GOAL

Polish **User Dashboard** so that:

* it feels clean, calm and confidence-building
* there are **no false errors** or red states
* user immediately understands **what they can do**
* dashboard is production-ready for first real users

This is NOT feature work. This is **UX + state + copy polish only**.

---

## 2️⃣ BLOCKERS (MUST BE FIXED)

### ❌ False error: "Failed to fetch artworks"

**Expected behaviour:**

* If user has **0 artworks** → show **neutral empty state**
* Red error state is shown **ONLY IF**:

  * API returns 4xx/5xx
  * network error
  * unauthorized access

**Empty state copy:**

> "No artworks yet. Upload your first artwork above."

**DO NOT:**

* retry automatically
* refactor API
* change backend logic

---

## 3️⃣ EMPTY STATE POLISH

### 🎨 My Artworks section

**When 0 artworks:**

* no red banners
* no technical language
* calm, encouraging tone

Optional helper text (allowed):

> "You can upload up to 3 artworks on the Free plan."

---

## 4️⃣ USER CLARITY & FIRST ACTION

### 🧭 Dashboard header clarity

Under **"User Dashboard"** title, add ONE short explanatory sentence:

> "Upload up to 3 artworks and instantly visualize them in our mockup rooms."

This is **copy only**, no layout refactor.

---

## 5️⃣ PRIMARY CTA CHECK

### ✅ Open Studio button

Verify:

* button is visible without scrolling
* leads to correct Studio route
* no console errors

**Do not rename or redesign button.**

---

## 6️⃣ PLAN CARD – KEEP AS IS

### 🟢 Your Plan (Free)

* Keep existing layout
* Keep feature list
* No upsell changes at this stage

This section is already OK.

---

## 7️⃣ ACCOUNT SECTION SANITY CHECK

### 🔐 Account Information / Change Password

Verify:

* fields render correctly
* no validation errors on load
* no broken submit states

No UX changes required unless something is broken.

---

## 8️⃣ WHAT NOT TO TOUCH ❌

* Pricing logic
* Plan limits
* Studio functionality
* API contracts
* Role system
* Admin impersonation logic

---

## 9️⃣ DEFINITION OF DONE ✅

User Dashboard is considered **DONE** when:

* [ ] No red error shown for empty artworks
* [ ] Empty state is clean and friendly
* [ ] User immediately understands what to do
* [ ] Open Studio works
* [ ] Page reload shows consistent state
* [ ] No console errors

Once all boxes are checked → **LOCK USER DASHBOARD** and move to **Artist**.

---

## 🔒 FINAL NOTE

This dashboard is the **first impression** of RoomVibe.
It must feel **safe, simple and professional**.

No rushing. No skipping.

When this is green → we move on.
