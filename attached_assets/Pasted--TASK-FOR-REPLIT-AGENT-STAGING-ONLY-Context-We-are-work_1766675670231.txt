# 🎯 TASK FOR REPLIT AGENT (STAGING ONLY)

## Context

We are working **ONLY on STAGING** (`staging.roomvibe.app`).
Goal: Finalize **User (Free plan)** logic, UI copy, pricing table, and widget branding.
After this task is completed and verified on staging, we will **synchronize to LIVE**.

---

## 1️⃣ Free Plan Logic – Artworks (CORE)

### Upload limits

* Free plan allows:

  * ✅ **3 clean artworks** (no branding)
  * ➕ **Up to 7 additional artworks WITH RoomVibe branding**
  * 🔢 **Total max artworks = 10**

### UI requirements

* Clearly distinguish between:

  * Clean artworks (first 3)
  * Branded artworks (additional 7)
* Artwork usage indicator example:

  * `Clean: 1 / 3`
  * `RoomVibe Powered: 0 / 7`
  * `Total: 1 / 10`

### Enforcement

* Upload logic must:

  * Block uploads beyond 10
  * Apply branding automatically to artworks #4–#10

---

## 2️⃣ User Dashboard – "Your Plan" Card (Free)

### Replace existing Artist copy with the following:

**Title (top right badge):**

* `Free`

**Status:**

* `Free`

**Description text:**

* `For people trying RoomVibe for the first time.`

**Feature list (exact copy):**

* Upload up to **3 artworks**
* Preview artworks in mockup rooms
* Embed Studio widget on your website
* Buy button integration
* Add up to **7 additional artworks with RoomVibe branding**

**CTA button:**

* `View all plans`

---

## 3️⃣ Widget Embed – RoomVibe Branding (NEW)

### Requirement

All **Free plan widgets** must show RoomVibe branding **below the embedded widget**.

### Branding text (EXACT COPY – Variant A)

**Powered by RoomVibe — preview art on real walls.**

### Behavior

* `RoomVibe` is a clickable link
* URL: `https://roomvibe.app`
* Opens in a new tab (`target="_blank"`)
* Visible on:

  * Public Studio link
  * Embedded iframe widget
* Only shown for **Free plan** (not paid plans)

---

## 4️⃣ Pricing Page – Free Plan Corrections

### Artwork uploads row

Change from:

* `3`

To:

* `3 + up to 7 branded`

(or similar short wording that clearly communicates branded extension)

### Feature availability fixes (Free column)

Set the following to ✅ (checkmark):

* Widget embed
* Buy button integration

### Remove feature entirely

* ❌ **Multi-art wall presentations**

  * Remove this row from the pricing table for **ALL plans** (not offered in Phase 1)

---

## 5️⃣ Scope & Rules

* ✅ STAGING ONLY
* ❌ DO NOT deploy to live
* ❌ DO NOT change Artist / Designer / Gallery logic unless directly affected by row removal
* ❌ No Stripe / billing logic changes

---

## 6️⃣ Acceptance Checklist (Agent must verify)

* [ ] Free user can upload 3 clean artworks
* [ ] Free user can upload +7 branded artworks (with visible RoomVibe branding)
* [ ] Upload blocked at 10 total
