Message for Replit Agent — Bugfix: Designer Dashboard Import Errors (ImpersonationBanner / ChangePassword)

Hi! After adding the Designer Dashboard, the deployment is failing with TypeScript errors:

Errors shown:

- TypeScript cannot find modules './ImpersonationBanner' and './ChangePassword' in:
    src/components/dashboards/DesignerDashboard.tsx

- TypeScript cannot find module './ImpersonationBanner' in:
    src/components/dashboards/ProjectDetail.tsx

- Build fails during the TypeScript compilation step (tsc -b) due to incorrect import paths.

This looks like a copy/paste issue from another dashboard (Admin/User), where these components exist in a different folder, or they were never created for the designer views.

What I need you to do:

1) Check where these components actually live in the codebase:
   - ImpersonationBanner
   - ChangePassword

2) Fix the imports in:
   - src/components/dashboards/DesignerDashboard.tsx
   - src/components/dashboards/ProjectDetail.tsx

   so that they point to the correct existing paths, e.g. something like:
   - ../../common/ImpersonationBanner
   - ../../account/ChangePassword
   (Exact paths depend on how you structured the project.)

3) If these components are NOT needed on DesignerDashboard / ProjectDetail:
   - Remove the imports
   - Remove the JSX usage of those components from these files.

4) Make sure that after the fix:
   - `tsc -b` passes without errors
   - The app builds and deploys successfully
   - /dashboard/designer and /dashboard/designer/project/:id load correctly in the browser.

Goal:
The Designer Dashboard and Project Detail should compile cleanly without missing module errors, and the deployment should succeed.

Thank you!
