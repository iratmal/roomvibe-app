# Task 4.1 — Premium Room Library (100 Rooms)

Goal  
Add a premium room library of ~100 scene presets to the RoomVibe Studio, with access limits per plan (Free / Basic / Pro).

Context  
Current room presets (Scenes) are already used in the Studio. Reuse the existing Studio structure and UI patterns.

Scope
1. Create data source for premium rooms
- Add a file, e.g. data/premiumRooms.ts.
- Export an array of ~100 room objects with this shape and generator:

```ts
export type PremiumRoom = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  imageUrl: string;
};

const categories = ["living_room", "bedroom", "office", "gallery"];

export const premiumRooms: PremiumRoom[] = Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, i) => {
  const index = i + 1;
  return {
    id: `PRM_ROOM_${index.toString().padStart(2, "0")}`,
    name: `Premium Room ${index}`,
    category: categories[i % categories.length],
    imageUrl: "/images/rooms/premium/default.jpg",
  };
});
```

2. Integrate premium rooms into Studio Scenes UI
- Locate the component that renders the Scenes list.
- Add a Premium Rooms section using the premiumRooms array.
- Use existing card style.

3. Apply plan-based access limits
- Free: 3 premium rooms.
- Basic: 30 premium rooms.
- Pro: all premium rooms.
- Others locked with overlay.

4. Locked state & upgrade modal
- Show lock overlay.
- Clicking locked room opens upgrade modal linking to pricing.

5. Keep standard rooms unchanged.

Stop Condition
- premiumRooms exists with 100 entries.
- Premium Rooms section visible.
- Free/Basic/Pro access limits enforced.
- Standard rooms unchanged.

Notes
- Reuse existing components.
- Do not refactor the whole Studio.
