# Message for Replit Agent – Full Hero Layout Update

Hi! I’d like to update the homepage hero section so that it matches the original full-width hero design (the one with the text and button overlayed directly on the room photo), instead of the current split two-column layout with a white background.

Below are the exact instructions:

---

## 1. Use the full hero image as the background of the hero section

The image has been uploaded to the `public/` folder:

**`roomvibe-hero-desktop.jpg`**

Please update the hero section so that it becomes **one full-width block** with this image as the background.

**Example structure:**

```
<section className="hero">
  <div className="hero-content">
    {/* text + button */}
  </div>
</section>
```

**CSS example:**

```
.hero {
  background-image: url("/roomvibe-hero-desktop.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  border-radius: 24px;
  padding: 72px 64px;
  margin-top: 32px;
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

---

## 2. Place the text + button on top of the image (left side)

Use the existing hero text:

* Heading: **Visualize Art on Your Walls — Instantly.**
* Subheading: **Preview real-size artwork on your wall or choose a preset room and start visualizing immediately.**
* Button: **Start Visualizing →** linking to `/studio`

Position them **over the background image**, aligned left.

**Example:**

```
.hero-content {
  max-width: 480px;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
  color: #ffffff; /* or keep navy if using overlay */
}
```

### Optional readability overlay (recommended)

If needed, add a soft left gradient so the text stands out:

```
.hero::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(
    to right,
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45),
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0)
  );
  border-radius: inherit;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

## 3. Remove the separate right-hand card

Please remove the image card (room-on-right) from the current two-column layout.

The hero must be:

* One full-width background image
* Text + button overlayed on top (left side)
* No additional image card

---

## 4. Mobile behavior

On mobile screens:

* The hero should remain a full-width background image.
* Text + button stack nicely with comfortable padding.
* Cropping is fine as long as the painting and sofa remain visible.

---

## 5. Keep all existing links

* **Start Visualizing →** must link to `/studio`.
* Lower CTA section (“Open Studio →”) remains unchanged.

---

## 6. Publish

After making these changes, please **Publish** so I can review the updated homepage.

Thanks so much!
