# 🎯 TASK FOR REPLIT AGENT – FREE PLAN: 3 CLEAN + 7 BRANDED ARTWORKS (UI LOGIC)

**Environment:** STAGING ONLY (staging.roomvibe.app)

---

## 🎯 Goal

For **User / Free plan**:

* Allow **up to 10 artworks total**
* First **3 artworks = CLEAN** (no RoomVibe branding)
* Next **7 artworks = BRANDED** (RoomVibe attribution/link)

This must be reflected in UI (Dashboard + Studio/Widget output).

---

# 1️⃣ FREE PLAN LIMITS & UI RULES

## A) Upload / Add Artwork

### Expected behavior

* Free users can upload up to **10 artworks**.
* When free user has **10/10**, the upload button is disabled and message shown.

### Messaging

When free user reaches 3 artworks:

* Show a gentle info note:

  > “You’ve used your 3 clean uploads. You can add up to 7 more artworks with RoomVibe branding.”

When free user reaches 10 artworks:

* Show:

  > “Free plan limit reached (10 artworks). Upgrade to Artist to upload more and remove branding.”

---

## B) Labeling in Dashboard – My Artworks

### Required UI changes

* On each artwork card (Free users only):

  * If artwork index (sorted by created_at asc) is **1–3** → show small label: **“Clean”**
  * If artwork index is **4–10** → show small label: **“RoomVibe Powered”** (or “Branded”)

> IMPORTANT: Use deterministic ordering (created_at asc) so the same artworks stay clean/branded.

---

## C) Usage Meter (Free users only)

Add a small meter / summary near “My Artworks”:

* **Clean uploads:** X / 3
* **RoomVibe-powered bonus:** Y / 7
* **Total:** (X+Y) / 10

Where:

* X = min(totalArtworks, 3)
* Y = max(totalArtworks - 3, 0)

---

# 2️⃣ STUDIO + WIDGET BRANDING RULE

## A) When to show branding

Branding applies ONLY for Free users and ONLY when the currently displayed artwork is in slots **4–10**.

### Clean artworks (1–3)

* No RoomVibe badge/watermark

### Branded artworks (4–10)

* Add a subtle attribution element:

  * A small badge or text in a corner (not intrusive)
  * Clickable link to RoomVibe (open in new tab)

**Recommended copy:**

* “Visualized with RoomVibe”

**Link target:**

* RoomVibe homepage or pricing (choose simplest: homepage)

> IMPORTANT: Do NOT put a large watermark across the artwork. Keep it elegant.

---

## B) Where to display branding

Implement branding overlay in **both**:

* Studio view
* Embedded widget view (iframe)

If the widget uses the same Studio renderer, reuse the same component.

---

# 3️⃣ PLAN DETECTION (What counts as Free?)

Use existing plan/role detection already used in dashboard:

* If user plan = Free/User
* Apply this 3+7 logic

Do NOT affect Artist / Designer / Gallery plans.

---

# 4️⃣ NO BACKEND CHANGES (Preferred)

Try to implement as:

* UI logic + rendering rules

However, if backend currently hard-limits Free to 3 artworks, update the limit to 10 for Free (minimal change), while keeping branding purely UI-side.

---

# 5️⃣ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (Smoke Test)

✅ Free user can upload 1–10 artworks
✅ Dashboard shows meter: clean (≤3) + bonus (≤7)
✅ Artwork cards show “Clean” for first 3 and “RoomVibe Powered” for next 7
✅ In Studio/widget:

* Clean artworks show NO branding
* Branded artworks show subtle “Visualized with RoomVibe” badge/link
  ✅ Paid plans (Artist/Designer/Gallery) are unchanged and never show branding

---

# 6️⃣ DEPLOYMENT RULE

⚠️ STAGING ONLY. Do NOT deploy to production.

---

**End of task.**
