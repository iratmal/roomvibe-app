BUG TASK — 360° Editor left panel collapse/expand is broken (sidebar re-open shows glitched layout)
Problem summary

In 360° Editor, when collapsing the left editor panel, an arrow remains to expand it again.
But clicking the arrow does not fully restore the panel — instead it opens a broken/glitched narrow panel layout (see screenshot 2).

Where

staging.roomvibe.app

/#/gallery/exhibitions/:id/360-editor

Editor layout: left sidebar (Wall Slots + Save buttons)

✅ Expected behavior

Collapse button hides panel cleanly.

Expand arrow restores panel to its full normal width and layout:

dropdown (gallery template)

wall slots list

selected slot dropdown + preview

Save button(s)

No “half-open” state, no clipped text, no broken scroll.

🔁 Steps to reproduce

Open 360° Editor

Collapse left panel

Click expand arrow

Observe: panel opens in broken narrow state / UI elements clipped (screenshot 2)

🔎 Investigation hints

Check if collapse/expand uses CSS classes (collapsed, w-0, w-[...], translateX, etc.)

Check if there is a third unintended state (e.g. collapsed=true but width still set small)

Possible conflict between:

responsive breakpoints (mobile/tablet layout)

persisted state in localStorage

drag-resize library / inline styles

🛠️ Required fix

Implement single source of truth for sidebar state:

sidebarState: "open" | "closed" (only 2 states)

On expand: force width back to default (e.g. 320–360px) and reset any inline width overrides.

Ensure pointer/click target is correct

Arrow button must call expand handler, not “back” or any other action.

Layout guard

When sidebar is collapsed:

the internal sidebar content should not partially render

When expanded:

render full content + enable scroll normally

QA on desktop

Test in Chrome + Firefox (because you’re using Firefox)

✅ Acceptance criteria

Collapse → expand works reliably every time

Expanded sidebar looks identical to initial load (same width, same components)

No clipped UI / weird vertical text

No console errors
