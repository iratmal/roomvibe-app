Goal:
Fix the artwork image handling so that:

after uploading an artwork, its image is persisted correctly,

the image is visible in the Artist dashboard card even after a full page refresh,

and the image is correctly shown in the Studio / “View in your room” view for that artwork.

Current problem (from user perspective):

I upload an artwork as an Artist (via the Artist dashboard).

Immediately after upload, everything seems ok.

But after I refresh the page, the artwork card still shows the title, size and price, but the image area is blank (no thumbnail).

Also, when I click “View in your room” (or open the Studio for that artwork), the Studio opens with the correct artwork selected, but the canvas is empty / no image is displayed.

What you should do (scope):

Locate the backend code that handles artwork image upload and storage (routes, controllers, models).

Confirm where the image file or image URL is supposed to be stored (e.g. in the database field like imageUrl).

Verify that, after uploading an artwork:

the image path/URL is actually being saved to the database,

and that the API response for listing artworks (used by the Artist dashboard) includes this image field.

Fix the Artist dashboard card rendering so that:

when the page loads and artworks are fetched from the backend,

each artwork’s image is displayed correctly in the card (no blank placeholder if an image exists).

Fix the Studio / “View in your room” image loading for that artwork:

ensure that when an artwork is selected (either via the widget artworkId or selection in the Studio),

the Studio loads and displays the correct artwork image on the canvas.

No empty canvas when a valid artwork image exists.

Test end-to-end:

Upload a new artwork with an image.

Refresh the Artist dashboard page → verify the image still appears on the card.

Use “View in your room” / widget to open the Studio for that artwork → verify the image is visible and rendered correctly in the Studio.

Important constraints (DO NOT):

Do not change Stripe, GA4 or any payment/membership logic.

Do not refactor unrelated parts of the app; keep changes focused on artwork image upload, storage and rendering.

Do not change the existing text fields behavior (title, size, price are already working).

Stop condition:

After uploading an artwork with an image, refreshing the Artist dashboard still shows the image thumbnail on the artwork card, and the same image is correctly displayed in the Studio / “View in your room” view for that artwork.
