Hi! I’d like a small UX polish + one new feature in the RoomVibe Studio view.

1) Clean up the right sidebar (Artwork panel)

In the Studio editor (route #/studio), in the right column where we have:

Artwork dropdown

Size (Width / Height / cm–in / Lock ratio)

Frame (Pro) – None / Slim / Gallery

View & Buy button

Please remove all helper text under the “View & Buy” button, specifically:

“Use #/studio to deep-link this editor.”

“Replace placeholders in src/data/artworks.json with Shopify CDN URLs, or set env vars to fetch automatically.”

I want the right panel to end visually with the View & Buy button and no text below it.

2) Enable drag-to-move for the artwork on the wall

Goal: In Studio, the user should be able to move (drag) the artwork around the wall:

Desktop: click + drag with the mouse

Mobile: touch + drag with finger

Implementation details (you can choose the best place in the code):

In the component that renders the artwork on top of the room scene (the canvas/overlay in the center panel), add state for the artwork position, e.g. offsetX, offsetY (or similar, relative to the wall/container).

Implement drag logic:

On mousedown / touchstart on the artwork, store the start position.

On mousemove / touchmove, update offsetX / offsetY so the artwork follows the pointer/finger.

On mouseup / touchend, finish the drag.

Constrain movement so that the artwork stays inside the wall area / mask:

It should not go outside the visible wall (no dragging out of bounds).

Use the existing wall mask / container bounds to clamp the position.

Keep the current sizing behaviour:

Width/Height fields in the Size section still define the size (scale) of the artwork.

Drag only changes the position, not the size.

Please add a small text button or link under the Size / Frame block, for example:

“Reset position”
When clicked, it should reset the artwork position back to the default (center of the wall / your current default).

Make sure drag works both:

with the default room presets (Artplacer Rooms 1–10), and

when the user uploads their own wall photo (Upload wall photo).

After implementing, please:

test on desktop and in mobile viewport (drag with touch),

run the build and deploy the updated version.

Thanks a lot!
