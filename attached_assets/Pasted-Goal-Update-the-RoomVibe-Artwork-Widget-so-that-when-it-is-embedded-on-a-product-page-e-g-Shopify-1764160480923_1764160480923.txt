Goal:
Update the RoomVibe Artwork Widget so that when it is embedded on a product page (e.g. Shopify), the Studio opens with a specific artwork preselected, based on an artworkId (or similar identifier) passed from the widget.

Context:

Project: RoomVibe

Current state:

The Artwork Widget Code is now working: when I embed it into a Shopify product and click “See in your room”, it opens the RoomVibe Studio with my artworks.

However, the Studio currently opens with the default artwork selection, not with the specific artwork that belongs to that product.

Desired state for this phase:

Each widget embed should be able to specify which artwork should be active when the Studio opens (e.g. via artworkId).

This is for my own artworks only (we are not building the full multi-artist system yet).

What you should do (scope):

Extend the Artwork Widget embed code to include an artwork identifier.

Locate the code that generates the Artwork Widget Code shown in the admin/artist dashboard.

Add a way to include a unique identifier for the artwork, e.g.:

a data-artwork-id="..." attribute on the container element, or

a query parameter in the Studio URL.

The embed code should still remain simple for the end user (copy → paste into Shopify/Etsy/WP).

Pass the artwork identifier to the Studio URL when the widget is used.

When the user clicks “See in your room” (or equivalent button), the Studio should be opened with a URL that contains the artwork identifier, e.g.:

https://app.roomvibe.app/studio?artworkId=XXXX

Choose a clean and consistent parameter name (artworkId or similar) and implement it end-to-end.

Update the Studio front-end to preselect the artwork on load.

On initial load of the Studio, read the artworkId (or chosen name) from the URL query params.

If the parameter is present and matches an existing artwork in the current catalogue:

set that artwork as the initially selected artwork in the Studio.

If the parameter is missing or invalid:

fall back to the current default behavior (default artwork as it works today).

Maintain backwards compatibility.

Existing widget embeds without an artworkId must continue to work exactly as they do now (open Studio with default artwork).

The new behavior should only apply when an artworkId is provided.

Test the full flow end-to-end.

In the RoomVibe admin, generate an Artwork Widget Code for a specific artwork (with its unique identifier).

Paste that code into a simple HTML test page and verify that:

the widget renders,

clicking the button opens the Studio with that exact artwork preselected.

Then test again by embedding the same code into a Shopify product description (HTML mode) and confirm that:

the widget appears on the product page,

clicking “See in your room” opens the Studio,

the correct artwork is preselected.

Important constraints (DO NOT):

Do not implement a full multi-artist marketplace or permissions system in this task.

Do not change Stripe, GA4, authentication, or any unrelated modules.

Do not refactor large parts of the codebase; keep changes limited to:

widget embed generation,

widget behavior,

Studio initialization logic around reading the artworkId.

Stop condition:

When I generate an Artwork Widget Code for a specific artwork in the RoomVibe admin, embed it into a Shopify product page, and click “See in your room”, the Studio opens and that specific artwork is immediately selected as the active artwork.

Existing embeds without an artworkId continue to work as before.
