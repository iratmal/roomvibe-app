🧩 TASK 1 – Smanjiti veličinu slike u odnosu na namještaj

Goal:
Slightly reduce the rendered artwork size in all Studio scenes so that “Whispers of the Ring” (and all other artworks) look a bit smaller in relation to the furniture and walls. The change should be global and subtle (around 10–15%), not drastic.

Context:

Project: RoomVibe

Screen: RoomVibe Studio (/studio route – scenes on the left, room preview in the center, artwork controls on the right).

Currently, the default artwork “Whispers of the Ring” looks slightly too large compared to furniture in most rooms (tables, sofas, beds, etc.).

Artwork scale is calculated based on artwork dimensions (e.g. 100×120 cm) against the virtual wall size.

Relevant files (naming may differ, adjust to actual project):

src/features/studio/components/StudioCanvas...

src/features/studio/hooks/useArtworkScale...

src/features/studio/components/ArtworkLayer...

Any utility that calculates artwork-to-wall scale.

Scope – do ONLY this:

Find where artwork scale/size is calculated

Locate the function(s) that convert real-world artwork dimensions into on-screen pixels inside the Studio preview.

This is likely where you calculate a scale factor using wall width vs artwork width.

Apply a global “slight reduction” factor

Introduce a small global modifier (for example 0.9 or similar) that makes all artworks ~10–15% smaller relative to the room furniture.

The change should affect all rooms/scenes consistently, not just a single room.

Keep aspect ratio and true-to-size logic

Do not break the existing true-to-size logic (100×120 cm must still map correctly relative to other sizes).

The change should be a consistent multiplier applied after the existing calculation, not a hard-coded pixel size.

Test in multiple rooms

Open at least:

Room 1 (current default with “Whispers of the Ring”)

One bedroom

One kitchen

One living room

Verify that artwork now looks slightly smaller and more natural compared to furniture, but not tiny.

Do NOT:

Do not change the aspect ratio of any artworks.

Do not change frame thickness or frame styles.

Do not touch upload-wall-photo logic.

Do not refactor unrelated Studio components.

Stop condition:
When artwork appears ~10–15% smaller in all scenes (visually more natural vs furniture), the true-to-size perception still works, and no layout or stretching bugs are introduced. Then summarize what factor you used and where.

Mode preference:
This is a focused visual tweak → use Fast Mode if available.

🧩 TASK 2 – Desni panel (Artwork/Frame) nestaje + krivi thumbnail na sekundu

Goal:
Fix the right-hand sidebar in the Studio so that:

It stays visible and scrollable (does not disappear from the screen after a second).

The thumbnail / artwork info on the top of the sidebar always matches the currently selected artwork (e.g. “Whispers of the Ring”, not “Light My Fire” flashing for a moment).

Context:

Screen: Artist Dashboard → Studio / RoomVibe Studio

Current behaviour:

When opening the Studio from the Artist Dashboard with artwork “Whispers of the Ring”:

The right sidebar appears for a split second with the wrong artwork (“Light My Fire”) at the top.

After that, the sidebar content essentially disappears / collapses – the right side looks empty or jumps out of view, so user cannot scroll or adjust frames properly.

Expected behaviour:

The sidebar must remain stable and visible.

Initial artwork in the dropdown and thumbnail must be the artwork actually selected in the Studio (“Whispers of the Ring” in this case).

No flashing of a different artwork.

Relevant areas (names approximate):

src/features/studio/pages/StudioPage...

src/features/studio/components/Sidebar/ArtworkSidebar...

Any context/store where selectedArtwork is managed (e.g. useStudioStore, useArtworkStore, StudioContext).

Scope – do ONLY this:

Fix initial artwork selection / flashing bug

Investigate how the selected artwork is initialized when entering the Studio from the Artist Dashboard.

Ensure that:

The sidebar uses the same selectedArtwork state as the main canvas.

There is no intermediate default like “Light My Fire” being set before the correct artwork is loaded.

Remove any hard-coded default artwork that overrides the incoming artwork for a moment.

Result: when Studio opens with “Whispers of the Ring”, the sidebar should immediately show “Whispers of the Ring” (no flash of another artwork).

Fix sidebar disappearing / layout issue

Investigate why the right panel disappears after a second:

Possibly caused by conditional rendering based on route, role, or missing artwork.

Or CSS/layout issue where the panel height gets collapsed or pushed out of viewport.

Ensure the sidebar:

Is always rendered on the Studio page for the current user role (Artist).

Has stable layout and remains visible and scrollable on desktop (like on the screenshot).

Check responsive behaviour but focus on desktop first.

Test flow from Artist Dashboard

From Artist Dashboard, open Studio with a specific artwork.

Confirm:

Sidebar appears once and stays on screen.

Sidebar artwork name/thumbnail matches the artwork on the canvas.

Changing artwork updates the sidebar correctly with no flicker.

Do NOT:

Do not redesign the sidebar UI.

Do not change copy, labels or button text.

Do not touch billing, roles or auth.

Do not refactor unrelated dashboard sections.

Stop condition:
When opening the Studio from the Artist Dashboard:

The right sidebar is visible, stable and scrollable the whole time.

No flashing of “Light My Fire” (or any wrong artwork) on first render.

The sidebar consistently shows the correct selected artwork.

Mode preference:
Also a jasno definiran bugfix → use Fast Mode if available.
