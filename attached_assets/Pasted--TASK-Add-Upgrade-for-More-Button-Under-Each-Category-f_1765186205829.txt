# TASK – Add “Upgrade for More” Button Under Each Category for Free and Artist Users

**Goal:**
For FREE and ARTIST plan users, in the Studio left sidebar, display an **“Upgrade for More”** button **under each category block**, so that a user can immediately upgrade when they reach the end of their available rooms for that category.

This must appear:

* Under **Bathroom** preview list
* Under **Bedroom** preview list
* Under **Kitchen** preview list
* Under **Kids** preview list
* Under **Living Room** preview list
* Under **Cafe** preview list (if present)

The button should appear only when the category is limited by the user’s current plan.

---

## ✅ PART 1 — WHEN BUTTON SHOULD APPEAR

### **Free Plan Users:**

Free plan users have access ONLY to the 10 basic rooms.

Therefore, **under every category**, after showing available rooms:

* Show a gold/amber button with label:
  **“Upgrade for More Rooms”**

This button should appear even if the Free user sees only 1–3 rooms in that category.

---

### **Artist Plan Users:**

Artist users have access to up to 30 standard rooms.

They should still see an upgrade button because Designer/Gallery tiers unlock:

* 100+ premium mockup rooms
* high‑resolution export
* PDF export
* designer tools
* gallery tools

So under each category for an Artist user:

* Show **“Unlock 100+ Premium Rooms → Upgrade”**

---

## ✅ PART 2 — BUTTON PLACEMENT

Button must appear:

* Directly **below the displayed room thumbnails** inside each category tab.
* Not at the bottom of the entire sidebar — instead, **per category**.

Visual example structure:

```
Bathroom
[Room thumbnail]
[Room thumbnail]
[Room thumbnail]

[ gold Upgrade button ]
```

Spacing:

* `mt-3` above button
* `mb-4` below button

---

## ✅ PART 3 — BUTTON ACTION / ROUTING

The button must trigger the **Upgrade flow modal** with the **correct recommended plan**.

Plan recommendation rules:

```ts
if (plan === "free") recommendedPlan = "artist";
if (plan === "artist") recommendedPlan = "designer";
```

Call the same upgrade modal that is used when clicking locked rooms.

---

## ✅ PART 4 — CONDITIONAL LOGIC

### Show the button if:

* `user.plan === "free"` → always
* `user.plan === "artist"` → always

### Do NOT show the button if:

* user is Designer
* user is Gallery
* user is All‑Access
* user is Admin

Implementation idea:

```tsx
{(plan === "free" || plan === "artist") && (
  <UpgradeButton onClick={() => openUpgradeModal(recommendedPlan)} />
)}
```

---

## ✅ PART 5 — DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

### Button style:

* Color: **gold / premium accent** (same as existing upgrade CTA)
* Full‑width inside category block
* Rounded corners consistent with RoomVibe UI
* Label variations:

  * Free → **“Upgrade for More Rooms”**
  * Artist → **“Unlock 100+ Premium Rooms → Upgrade”**

### Hover State:

* Slight darkened gold tone

---

## ✅ PART 6 — TESTING CHECKLIST

### FREE USER

* Sees 10 basic rooms total
* Under each category (Bathroom, Bedroom, Kids, etc.) sees **Upgrade for More Rooms** button
* Clicking button opens upgrade modal recommending **Artist** plan

### ARTIST USER

* Sees up to 30 rooms across categories
* Under each category sees **Unlock 100+ Premium Rooms → Upgrade** button
* Clicking button opens upgrade modal recommending **Designer** plan

### DESIGNER / GALLERY / ALL‑ACCESS

* No upgrade buttons appear in categories

### ADMIN

* No upgrade buttons appear

---

## MODE

Use **Fast Mode** — UI injection + conditional logic.

---

## STOP CONDITION

* Every category for Free/Artist users ends with an appropriate Upgrade button.
* Buttons trigger correct upgrade modal.
* Premium‑tier users and Admins never see the buttons.
