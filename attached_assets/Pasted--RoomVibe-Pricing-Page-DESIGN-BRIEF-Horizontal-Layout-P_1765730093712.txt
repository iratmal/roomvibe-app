# RoomVibe Pricing Page – DESIGN BRIEF (Horizontal Layout)

**Purpose:**
Redesign the Pricing page to be extremely clear, calm, and understandable for non-technical users (including older artists). The goal is clarity first, premium second, and conversion third.

This redesign **replaces the current pricing tables**.

## 1. GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES (VERY IMPORTANT)

* Target user: *non-technical artists*, including older users (60–70+ years)
* Language: **simple, plain English**
* No dense text blocks
* Strong visual hierarchy
* Easy vertical scanning
* No visual clutter

Avoid:

* grey dashes (—)
* overly long paragraphs
* technical terminology

---

## 2. COLOR SYSTEM (STRICT – NO DEVIATION)

Use **only official RoomVibe colors** for feature indicators:

### Primary (YES / INCLUDED)

* Used as **filled square background**
* **White checkmark** inside (`#FFFFFF`)

### Not Included (NO)

* **Gold:** `#C9A24D`
* Used as **gold X icon**
* No filled background

❗ Do NOT use green or red icons
❗ Do NOT use grey dashes

2. **Feature Comparison (Detailed)**

Both tables must be horizontal and aligned.
