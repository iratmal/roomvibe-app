Message for Replit Agent — Combined Task: Room 4 Scaling Fix + Studio Polish Pack

Hi! This file includes TWO tasks in one combined package:

1) Room 4 – Real-Size Scaling Fix  
2) Studio Polish Pack (final UX/UI refinements)

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 1 — FIX WALL SCALING FOR ROOM 4 (Incorrect Real Size)
------------------------------------------------------------
Room 4 currently displays artworks far too large compared to the furniture.  
Rooms 1–3 are correct, only Room 4 has incorrect wall dimensions.

Please correct the real wall dimensions for Room 4 using the following calibrated values:

Correct wall dimensions:
- wallWidthCm: 370
- wallHeightCm: 250

These values produce true-to-life proportions relative to the sofa, chairs, sideboard, and match the scale consistency with Rooms 1–3.

EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX:
- A 100×150 cm artwork should appear proportionally accurate in Room 4.
- No more oversized look.
- Real-size scaling remains correct.
- Frames and drag/resize behavior must still work normally.

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 2 — STUDIO POLISH PACK (Final UX Enhancement)
------------------------------------------------------------
This task focuses on final polish and improving the professional feel of the Studio.

PLEASE IMPLEMENT THE FOLLOWING:

1) Artwork Selection Improvements
- When artwork is selected: show subtle outline + corner handles.
- When clicked away: deselect and hide handles.
- Ensure selection state is smooth and flicker-free.

2) Resize Handle Styling
- Make handles visually consistent across all frames.
- Use modern minimal styling (e.g., small circles or squares).
- Ensure handles stay visible even when frames are applied.

3) Floating Frame & Mat Depth Simulation (LIGHT)
- Add subtle inner shadows or very light outlines to floating frame and mat to improve realism.
- Keep performance high and avoid heavy box shadows.

4) Smooth Transitions Between Frames
- When switching frames, avoid sudden jumps.
- Apply small fade or scale transition (100–150ms).
- Keep position and current size stable.

5) Cleanup & Consistency
- Remove any leftover white edges or gaps.
- Ensure all frames from the 12-frame library follow unified spacing logic.
- Make sure mat + frame combinations are visually clean.

6) Fine-Tune Mobile Controls
- Make pinch-zoom smoother.
- Ensure drag and pinch do not conflict.
- Add small dead zone to avoid accidental drags when tapping frame buttons.

7) Performance Optimizations
- Use CSS transforms for movement and scale.
- Reduce unnecessary React re-renders.
- Ensure Studio runs smoothly on mid-range phones.

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
------------------------------------------------------------
After completing both tasks:

Room 4:
- Artwork appears proportional and consistent with real-world sizes.
- Real-size scaling perfectly matches furniture.

Studio Polish:
- Artwork selection feels natural.
- All resize handles function correctly.
- All frame styles render cleanly.
- Switching frames looks smooth and professional.
- No white edges anywhere.
- Pinch-zoom and drag work flawlessly on mobile.
- Entire Studio feels premium and production-ready.

Thank you!
