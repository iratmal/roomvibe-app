Ujednačiti veličinu slike preko svih soba (Room 4 i Room 8 su preveliki)

Goal:
Normalize the artwork scale across all preset rooms in RoomVibe Studio so that a 100 × 120 cm artwork looks visually consistent in relation to furniture and wall size in every scene.
Currently, Room 4 and Room 8 render the artwork noticeably larger than other rooms – these need to be corrected to match rooms where scale already looks natural (e.g. Room 1).

Context

Screen: RoomVibe Studio (/studio)

Preset scenes: Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, … (including new café / living rooms).

When using artwork “Whispers of the Ring” (100 × 120 cm):

In Room 1 the artwork looks natural vs table/sofa.

In Room 4 and Room 8 the same artwork appears too large relative to the furniture and wall.

This indicates that per-room wall calibration / scale is off for some scenes.

Likely places to check:

src/data/rooms.ts (or similar) – per-room config (wall width/height, scale, artwork area).

Components that define the artwork bounding box / scale area for each preset room (e.g. RoomSceneConfig, sceneConfig, artworkArea, etc.).

Utilities for cm → pixels mapping inside Studio.

Scope – do ONLY this

Identify the per-room scale / wall config

Find where each room’s “virtual wall” is defined (for presets, not uploaded walls).

Typical values might be:

physical wall width/height in cm

a scale factor / zoom

an artwork bounding rect on the background image.

Confirm that Room 1 has a correct & natural calibration.

Use Room 1 as the baseline

Treat Room 1 as the reference scene for how big a 100 × 120 cm artwork should appear relative to furniture.

Derive a “pixels per cm” or equivalent scale factor from Room 1’s config.

Adjust Room 4 and Room 8 to match the baseline

For Room 4 and Room 8:

Adjust their wall / scale / bounding-box parameters so that a 100 × 120 cm artwork appears visually similar in size to Room 1.

Goal: when switching between Room 1, Room 4 and Room 8 with the same artwork, the artwork size should feel consistent vs tables/sofas (no scene where it looks dramatically larger).

Do NOT tweak this via arbitrary zoom in the canvas – fix it in the scene config so it’s robust.

Quick check for other presets

Quickly compare a 100 × 120 cm artwork in a few other rooms (one bedroom, one bathroom, one kitchen).

If any room clearly looks way off (much larger or much smaller than Room 1), adjust its config slightly to bring it in line.

Keep changes small and subtle – we want consistency, not identical composition.

Keep true-to-size behaviour

Ensure that the true-to-size logic remains intact:

If the user switches from 50 × 70 cm to 100 × 140 cm, the relative difference must still be correct.

The fix should be per-room base scale calibration, not hard-coded pixel sizes.

Test

Use “Whispers of the Ring” (100 × 120 cm) as the test artwork.

Compare Room 1, Room 4, Room 8 + at least one bedroom and one kitchen.

Confirm:

Artwork looks naturally proportional to furniture in all scenes.

No room where artwork suddenly feels 30–40% larger than others.

Do NOT

Do not change frame styles, thickness or frame positions.

Do not touch upload-wall-photo logic or user-uploaded wall scaling.

Do not refactor Studio layout or categories.

Do not change artwork aspect ratios.

Stop condition

With the same artwork (100 × 120 cm), switching between Room 1, Room 4, Room 8 and other presets shows visually consistent artwork size relative to the furniture and walls.

Room 4 and Room 8 no longer feel “zoomed in” or oversized.

True-to-size scaling still behaves correctly between different artwork dimensions.

Mode preference:
This is a calibration / fine-tuning task → use Fast Mode if available.
