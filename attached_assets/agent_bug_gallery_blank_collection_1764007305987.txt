Message for Replit Agent — Critical Bug: Gallery “View Collection” opens a blank screen

Hi! The Gallery Dashboard still has a critical issue.

-----------------------------------
🔴 Problem
-----------------------------------
When I am logged in as Gallery (or using Admin → View as Gallery):

1. I go to /dashboard/gallery
2. I create a new collection — this part works
3. I click “View Collection” on the created collection
4. The app navigates to:

   /dashboard/gallery/collection/1   (or similar ID)

…but the entire page is blank white.

No header, no content, no error component, nothing.

This happens every time, even without adding any artwork. So the component breaks immediately on mount.

-----------------------------------
🔍 What this likely means technically
-----------------------------------
This is almost certainly caused by one of:

- an unhandled exception in the CollectionDetail component on initial render
- a failing fetch (API returns unexpected structure → JS error → React crash)
- a missing import (component used but not defined)
- a crash inside routing (e.g. undefined “collection” object)
- or wrong path resolution for the role-based dashboards

Because the blank screen is full white, this means React is failing at top level inside the component, not inside the form.

-----------------------------------
🧪 Please check:
-----------------------------------

1) Frontend console

- Open the browser console while reproducing the “blank screen”.
- Check what exact React error appears (stack trace and message).

Typical issues:
- “Cannot read property X of undefined”
- “… is not a function”
- “Failed to fetch …”
- “Module not found: …”

2) API for GET collection

Check the endpoint, e.g.:

  GET /api/gallery/collections/:id

Ensure it returns a stable structure, for example:

  { success: true, collection: { ... } }

If it returns:
- empty object
- undefined
- an error

…the component may be trying to access fields that don’t exist and crash.

3) Component imports

Make sure the collection detail view uses correct imports for:
- any Layout / Card / shared components
- no leftover imports from Artist/Designer dashboards that don’t exist for Gallery

4) Defensive rendering

Even if the collection is not found or the artworks array is empty, the page should still render a friendly message, not crash.

-----------------------------------
✔️ Expected result
-----------------------------------
When I click “View Collection”, the following must happen:

- Page loads normally
- Collection header is displayed
- Upload artwork form is displayed
- Artworks list is displayed (empty at first)
- No blank screen under any circumstances

This must work even when:
- the collection has 0 artworks
- some optional fields are empty
- the server returns an empty artworks array

Please fix this render crash for the Gallery collection detail view and let me know when it’s resolved so I can re-test.

Thank you!
