# TASK – Display the 10 Free Plan Rooms as the Default Visible Rooms in Studio

**Goal:**
Ensure that when a **Free Plan user** (or a user not logged in yet) enters the **RoomVibe Studio**, the **first visible list of rooms** on the left side is *exactly the 10 basic rooms assigned to the Free Plan*.

These rooms must appear immediately on Studio load, without requiring the user to click on any category or filter.

This must work consistently:

* on initial Studio page load,
* after hard refresh,
* after login,
* after returning from dashboard.

---

# ✅ PART 1 — REQUIRED DEFAULT BEHAVIOR

When a Free Plan user opens `/studio`, the left sidebar should automatically display **only** these 10 rooms:

### **Bathroom (2)**

1. Bathroom 7
2. Bathroom 10

### **Bedroom (3)**

3. Bedroom 4
4. Bedroom 5
5. Bedroom 6

### **Kitchen (2)**

6. Kitchen 18
7. Kitchen 19

### **Living Room (3)**

8. Living Room 12
9. Living Room 16
10. Living Room 21

These should be the **first and only rooms visible** in the left sidebar when the Studio loads for a Free user.

---

# ✅ PART 2 — LOGIC FIX

Update Studio initialization logic so that:

```ts
if (plan === "free") {
   displayedRooms = rooms.filter(r => r.basicFree === true);
   setSelectedCategory("All"); // avoid category override
   return;
}
```

Important:

* The app must NOT preload all rooms and then filter by category.
* The app must NOT show Artist/Designer rooms on first load.
* The Free list must be loaded **before** any category grouping.

---

# ✅ PART 3 — CATEGORY BEHAVIOR FOR FREE USERS

If categories exist (e.g., Bathroom, Bedroom, Kitchen, Living):

* Only categories relevant to the 10 free rooms should appear.
* No empty categories should be shown.
* Category switching must still filter within the **basicFree** set.

Example:

```ts
if (plan === "free") {
  categories = deriveCategoriesFrom(basicFreeRooms);
}
```

---

# ✅ PART 4 — AVOID ANY PREMIUM / STANDARD ROOMS ON FIRST LOAD

Free users must NOT:

* see premium or standard rooms on Studio open,
* scroll past the 10 free rooms,
* load additional rooms in the background.

This means:

```ts
if (plan === "free") {
   return basicFreeRoomsOnly;
}
```

Not:

```ts
loadAllAndThenFilterLater() // ❌ reject this pattern
```

---

# ✅ PART 5 — ADMIN EXCEPTION

Admins must still see all rooms.

```ts
if (user.isAdmin) return rooms;
```

---

# ✅ PART 6 — TEST CASES

### **Test: Free User Opens Studio**

* Only the 10 free rooms are in sidebar ✔
* No premium or standard rooms appear ✔
* No scroll past the free rooms ✔

### **Test: Admin Opens Studio**

* All rooms appear ✔

### **Test: User Upgrades to Artist**

* Sidebar reloads to show 30 rooms (10 free + 20 standard) ✔

### **Test: Returning to Studio**

* Correct room set loads every time ✔

---

# MODE

Use **Fast Mode**.

---

# STOP CONDITION

When a Free user loads Studio, the **left sidebar displays ONLY the 10 Free rooms**, in the exact order defined, without requiring any interaction or filter switching.
