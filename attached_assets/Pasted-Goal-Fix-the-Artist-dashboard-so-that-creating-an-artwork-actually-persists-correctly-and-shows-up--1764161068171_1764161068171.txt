Goal:
Fix the Artist dashboard so that creating an artwork actually persists correctly and shows up with all its data (including image) after a page refresh.

Current problem:

I log in as an Artist and fill out all fields for a new artwork (title, image, etc.).

When I click Upload Artwork, I no longer get a server error, but:

after the page refreshes, the top form fields are empty again,

in the list/grid below I only see an item like “My Artwork” (title), without image and without the rest of the data.

If I manually refresh the Artist dashboard page, the artwork data is basically gone / incomplete.

What you should do (scope):

Find the backend endpoint and model used for creating/saving artworks for Artists.

Search for routes/controllers related to: artist, artworks, uploadArtwork, etc.

Confirm what is supposed to be stored in the database for an artwork (title, description, price, image URL/path, etc.).

Fix the create/save logic so that:

all form fields are correctly validated and saved,

the image is stored (or its URL is stored) in the appropriate field,

no data is lost after the request completes.

Fix the Artist dashboard “list” fetch so that after a full page refresh:

the Artist dashboard loads artworks from the database,

each artwork entry shows the correct title, image, and metadata (not just “My Artwork” with no image).

Test the full flow:

create a new artwork from the Artist dashboard,

confirm it is saved in the DB with all fields,

refresh the page,

confirm the artwork is still there and rendered correctly with its image.

Important constraints (DO NOT):

Do not change Stripe, GA4, membership, or any unrelated systems.

Do not refactor unrelated parts of the dashboard.

Just make sure that creating artworks for Artists persists correctly and renders correctly after refresh.

Stop condition:

When I can create an artwork in the Artist dashboard, refresh the page, and see that artwork (with its image and data) still present and correctly displayed in the artworks list.
