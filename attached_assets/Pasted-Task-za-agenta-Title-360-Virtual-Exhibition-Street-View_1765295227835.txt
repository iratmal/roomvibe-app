Title: 360° Virtual Exhibition – Street View Navigation & Realism Upgrade (V2)

Goal:
Upgrade the existing 360° Virtual Exhibition so it feels like walking through a real gallery (similar to Artsteps), with Street-View style navigation and more realistic visuals (walls, floor, lighting, artwork scale & frames).

1) Street-View style navigation (public viewer)

Current:
User jumps between fixed camera viewpoints via bottom buttons.

Update to:

Keep the four main viewpoints (Entrance, Center, Back Left, Back Right), but:

Replace or complement the bottom buttons with floor hotspots (round markers or subtle circles on the floor).

Clicking a hotspot teleports the camera smoothly to that position.

Navigation behaviour:

Mouse/touch drag to look around (left–right & slightly up–down), with smooth, limited rotation.

Camera height stays constant at eye level (no tilting into the ceiling or floor).

Transition between hotspots uses a short lerp animation (0.4–0.6s), no abrupt jumps.

Constraints:

Prevent the camera from ever ending up outside the gallery volume (no seeing “void” above or below).

FOV and distance tuned so artworks feel like a real viewing distance in a mid-size gallery.

2) More realistic gallery space (Modern Gallery first)

Use the Modern Gallery environment as the primary reference for realism.

Walls & floor

Walls: slightly warm neutral gray, smooth PBR material with subtle roughness, no banding.

Floor: light stone / polished concrete look (similar feel to Artsteps example), with soft reflection/roughness.

Make the main wall planes wider so the user doesn’t immediately see edges/void when rotating the camera.

Ceiling & lights

Simple, elegant modern ceiling beams or tracks (we already have something similar – refine it).

Add a row of spotlights above artworks that:

Cast soft, oval light on the wall.

Optionally cast a very soft shadow just under the frame.

No visible “space void”

Ensure the full 360° view is always inside the gallery geometry:

Closed ceiling and continuous floor.

Camera clipping or sky color tuned so user never sees pure black/white outside.

3) Artwork realism (scale, proportions, frames)

Correct physical scaling

Use the artwork’s real dimensions from the database (width/height in cm) to calculate the scale of the plane in 3D.

Paintings with different formats (e.g. 150×100 vs 100×100) must clearly look different in size on the wall, matching real-world proportions.

Frames

Each artwork should be rendered as:

A main artwork plane.

A thin frame around it (slightly darker or lighter, with bevel).

The frame should add a bit of depth from the wall (few centimeters), so it doesn’t look like a sticker.

Brightness & color

Ensure that artwork textures are not darkened:

Gamma/tonemapping so colors look close to the original image (compare to Studio preview).

Light intensity balanced so whites are not blown out, but paintings look vivid and not dull.

4) Editor UX tweaks (360° Editor)

Always show a stable wall view

For each camera position (Entrance / Center / Back Left / Back Right), default camera angle should:

Look straight at the relevant wall segment.

Keep horizon straight (no heavy tilt towards floor/ceiling).

Avoid camera angles where the user sees mostly ceiling or floor.

Wall labels & slots

Keep the left sidebar with wall slots as is (it works well).

Make sure that when a user clicks a wall slot, the camera smoothly rotates so that slot’s wall is clearly visible.

5) Technical notes

Keep using React Three Fiber + Three.js, but refactor if needed:

Encapsulate gallery geometry + lights into a reusable component (ModernGalleryScene).

Encapsulate camera + hotspots logic into something like StreetViewController.

No backend changes to schema for now – reuse existing exhibition & artwork assignments.

6) Acceptance criteria

From a gallery collection card, clicking “360°” opens the editor. Editor shows a realistic Modern Gallery space with correctly scaled artworks and frames.

In the public 360° viewer, users:

Rotate view with mouse/touch.

Move by clicking floor hotspots, with smooth teleport and no “falling out” of the room.

Artworks clearly differ in size according to their real dimensions.

Overall impression: feels like you are inside a real, modern gallery (similar realism level to Artsteps), not a simple gray box.
