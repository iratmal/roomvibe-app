# 🏛️ TASK — Ceiling + Wall Refinement (SAFE MODE)

## Context

* Camera buttons now work (Entrance/Center/Back Left/Back Right)
* We **do NOT touch** camera logic, lighting logic, renderer settings, or shadows in this task.
* Goal is purely **visual architecture**: ceiling + walls should feel more like a real gallery space.

---

## ✅ SAFE MODE RULES (non-negotiable)

1. ❌ Do NOT change any light logic (no spotlight generation, no renderer exposure, no toneMapping changes)
2. ❌ Do NOT change camera controls / transitions
3. ✅ Only edit: **ceiling geometry**, **ceiling materials**, **wall materials**, and (optional) **very subtle wall finish**

If anything breaks → revert only the last small change.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* **More "gallery height" feeling** (3–5m vibe) without risking system instability
* Ceiling details look intentional (coffer/beam logic, symmetrical)
* Walls look premium (soft matte, subtle realism) so artworks pop

---

# PART A — Ceiling (priority)

## A1) Increase perceived height (SAFE)

Choose ONE approach (prefer A):

### Option A (recommended): visual lightening

* Make ceiling **5–10% lighter** than current
* Reduce the visual “weight” of beams:

  * slightly thinner beams OR
  * slightly lower contrast between beams and ceiling panels

### Option B: raise ceiling height (only if very easy)

* Increase ceiling Y height by **+10% to +20%**
* Do NOT move lights/camera
* If raising causes artifacts, revert and stick to Option A.

✅ Acceptance: in Center view ceiling should not feel “low and heavy”.

---

## A2) Make ceiling pattern intentional (symmetry)

Current ceiling has tracks/lines + beams.

* Align beams/lines so they are **perfectly symmetrical** to the room
* Ensure spacing is consistent (no random offsets)
* Keep it clean and premium (museum style)

✅ Acceptance: when looking at ceiling, it feels designed, not accidental.

---

## A3) Add subtle depth (coffer feel) — OPTIONAL if easy

* Add simple recessed panels between beams OR bevel edges
* Low poly is fine; we need light-catching edges

✅ Acceptance: ceiling gets depth even without changing lights.

---

# PART B — Walls (second priority)

## B1) Premium matte wall material

* Keep current wall color family (warm neutral)
* Add subtle material properties:

  * low metalness (0)
  * high roughness (0.85–0.95)

If using StandardMaterial:

* ensure color stays consistent

---

## B2) Subtle wall texture / finish (very subtle)

Add a very light texture or procedural noise so walls are not flat.
Rules:

* Must be almost invisible
* No visible repeating pattern
* Should only be noticeable when close to the wall

Options:

* light plaster texture
* micro noise bump (very low)

✅ Acceptance: wall looks more real, but still clean gallery.

---

## B3) Optional micro-gradient (only if easy)

If you have a clean way:

* top part of wall: ~2–3% lighter
* bottom part: ~2–3% darker

This increases realism without changing lights.

---

# PART C — Quick visual checks (must do)

Take screenshots:

1. Center (full wall with artworks)
2. Back Left
3. One close-up of a wall corner (to see material realism)

---

## ✅ Done / Acceptance criteria

* [ ] No changes to camera logic
* [ ] No changes to lighting logic
* [ ] Ceiling looks lighter and more premium
* [ ] Ceiling pattern is symmetrical / intentional
* [ ] Walls look matte and slightly realistic (subtle texture)
* [ ] Scene never goes black

---

## Implementation notes (for agent)

* Keep changes incremental: commit after A1, then A2, then B1, etc.
* If any regression: revert only the last step and continue.
