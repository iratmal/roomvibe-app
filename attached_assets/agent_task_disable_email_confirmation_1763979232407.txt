Message for Replit Agent — TEMPORARILY DISABLE EMAIL CONFIRMATION

Hi! Registration is now working and I get the success message:

"Successfully registered, please check your email to confirm your account."

However, no confirmation email is arriving in my inbox (or spam), so right now this step is blocking me from using the app properly.

For the MVP, I would like you to **temporarily disable mandatory email confirmation** and auto‑verify new users on registration.

**What I’d like you to do now (MVP version):**

1. After successful registration:
   - Mark the user as verified (e.g. `emailVerified = true` or remove that check entirely for now).
   - Automatically log the user in.
   - Redirect them to the correct dashboard based on their selected role (user / artist / designer / gallery).

2. Make sure the login flow:
   - Does NOT block unverified users.
   - Does NOT show any “please confirm your email” error.
   - Works immediately after registration with the same email/password.

3. Keep the code structure so that later we can:
   - Plug in a real email provider,
   - Re‑enable proper email verification with tokens/links,
   - But for now it must not be required.

**Goal for now:**
- Register → immediately be able to log in and use the app (no real email confirmation needed yet).

Once this is done, please test on production with a fresh email and confirm that:
- Registration succeeds,
- I can log in right after,
- I land on the appropriate dashboard for my role.

Thank you!
