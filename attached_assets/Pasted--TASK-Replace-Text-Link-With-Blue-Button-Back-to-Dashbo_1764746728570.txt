# TASK: Replace Text Link With Blue Button → "Back to Dashboard" (Studio Header)

## GOAL
Improve navigation clarity and UI consistency by replacing the existing text link
("← Back to Home") with a **primary blue button** labeled **"← Back to Dashboard"**.

This creates a clear, premium, and consistent navigation element across Studio.

---

# REQUIRED CHANGES

## 1) Remove the existing text link
Remove or hide the current inline navigation:

`← Back to Home`

---

## 2) Add a primary blue button labeled "← Back to Dashboard"

Button style (match existing primary buttons):

```
background: #283593;       /* RoomVibe Navy */
color: #FFFFFF;
font-size: 14px;
font-weight: 500;
padding: 8px 16px;
border-radius: 8px;
display: inline-flex;
align-items: center;
gap: 6px;
cursor: pointer;
border: none;
```

**Icon:**  
Use lucide-react `arrow-left`  
- size: 16px  
- stroke: 1.75px  
- color: white  

---

## 3) Placement in header

Position the button:

- top-left section of Studio header  
- aligned vertically with the Studio title  
- consistent spacing (same margin-left as original text link)

Example layout:

```
[← Back to Dashboard]         RoomVibe Studio
```

On mobile:

```
[← Dashboard]
(RoomVibe Studio centered)
```

---

## 4) Navigation behavior

On click → redirect to:

```
/dashboard
```

No other change to routing logic.

---

## 5) Mobile responsiveness

For screens under 768px:

- button becomes slightly smaller:
```
padding: 6px 12px;
font-size: 13px;
border-radius: 6px;
```

- optionally shorten label to:
`← Dashboard`

Keep the same blue styling.

---

# STOP CONDITIONS

Task is complete when:

✓ Text link is fully replaced with a blue button  
✓ Button matches RoomVibe primary button style  
✓ Arrow icon appears correctly  
✓ Button redirects to `/dashboard`  
✓ Mobile version uses the same button (or shortened label)  
✓ Layout remains clean and aligned on all screen sizes  

---

# NOTES

- Do not modify other navigation items.  
- This is purely a visual and UX polish task.
