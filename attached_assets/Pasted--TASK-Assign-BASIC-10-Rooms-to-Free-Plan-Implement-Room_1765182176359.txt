# TASK – Assign BASIC 10 Rooms to Free Plan & Implement Room Filtering by Plan

**Goal:**
Implement the new FREE PLAN room set by assigning the specified 10 rooms as **basic_free_rooms** and updating Studio filtering logic so each plan only sees the rooms allowed for their tier.

This task ensures:

* Free users see ONLY the 10 basic rooms.
* Artist sees 10 basic + up to 20 standard rooms (total 30).
* Designer / Gallery / All‑Access see **all rooms** (standard + premium).
* Admin bypasses all restrictions.

---

# ✅ PART 1 — BASIC 10 ROOMS (FREE PLAN)

Mark the following rooms as **basic_free_rooms: true** in the room metadata:

### **Bathroom (2)**

1. Bathroom **7**
2. Bathroom **10**

### **Bedroom (3)**

3. Bedroom **4**
4. Bedroom **5**
5. Bedroom **6**

### **Kitchen (2)**

6. Kitchen **18**
7. Kitchen **19**

### **Living Room (3)**

8. Living Room **12**
9. Living Room **16**
10. Living Room **21**

Store this as a dedicated room tag: `basicFree: true`.

---

# ✅ PART 2 — PLAN‑BASED ROOM VISIBILITY

Update the Studio room filtering logic as follows:

### **FREE PLAN**

User should see **only** rooms tagged `basicFree: true`.

Filtering rule:

```ts
if (plan === "free") {
  return rooms.filter(r => r.basicFree === true);
}
```

---

### **ARTIST PLAN**

User should see:

* all `basicFree: true` rooms (10)
* plus **standard: true** rooms (20 additional)

Total: **up to 30 rooms**.

Filtering rule:

```ts
if (plan === "artist") {
  return rooms.filter(r => r.basicFree || r.standard === true);
}
```

*(Ensure Artist does NOT see premium rooms.)*

---

### **DESIGNER, GALLERY, ALL‑ACCESS**

User should see **all rooms** (standard + premium).

Filtering rule:

```ts
if (plan === "designer" || plan === "gallery" || plan === "allaccess") {
  return rooms; // full library
}
```

---

### **ADMIN**

Admin always sees ALL rooms, no filters.

```ts
if (user.isAdmin) return rooms;
```

---

# ✅ PART 3 — UPDATE ROOM METADATA STRUCTURE

Ensure each room object includes:

```ts
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  category: "bathroom" | "bedroom" | "kitchen" | "living" | ...,
  basicFree?: boolean,
  standard?: boolean,
  premium?: boolean,
  imageUrl: string,
  ...
}
```

Rooms not in basic or standard lists should default to `premium: true`.

---

# ✅ PART 4 — TESTING

### FREE PLAN

* Should show exactly **10 rooms** listed above.
* No other rooms appear.

### ARTIST PLAN

* Should show 10 basic + 20 standard = **30 rooms max**.
* Should NOT show premium rooms.

### DESIGNER / GALLERY / ALL‑ACCESS

* Should show the full list of rooms (100+).

### ADMIN

* Should always see all rooms.
* Should never see upgrade prompts.

---

# MODE PREFERENCE

Use **Fast Mode** – this is a filtering + metadata tagging task.

---

# STOP CONDITION

* Free users see ONLY the 10 specified rooms.
* Artist sees up to 30 rooms.
* Premium-tier plans see everything.
* Admin bypass applies.
* Room data structure is updated with tags for future scalability.
