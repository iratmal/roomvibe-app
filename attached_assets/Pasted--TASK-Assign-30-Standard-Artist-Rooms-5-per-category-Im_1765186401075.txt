# TASK – Assign 30 Standard Artist Rooms (5 per category) & Implement Filtering Logic

**Goal:**
Implement the **Artist Plan room set**, which includes **30 standard rooms**, divided as **5 rooms per category**. These rooms must be visible to Artist, Designer, Gallery, All-Access plans, and Admin. Free users must NOT see these rooms.

This task also ensures that:

* Free Plan displays **only 10 basic rooms**
* Artist Plan displays **30 rooms total** (10 basic + 20 additional standard)
* Premium rooms remain locked for Designer/Gallery/All-Access only
* Admin bypasses all filters

---

# ✅ PART 1 — Assign Standard Rooms for ARTIST PLAN (30 total)

Mark the following rooms as:

```json
standard: true
```

These rooms form the full Artist Plan offering.

---

## **BATHROOM (5)**

* Bathroom 3
* Bathroom 4
* Bathroom 5
* Bathroom 7 *(basicFree)*
* Bathroom 10 *(basicFree)*

---

## **BEDROOM (5)**

* Bedroom 4 *(basicFree)*
* Bedroom 5 *(basicFree)*
* Bedroom 6 *(basicFree)*
* Bedroom 8
* Bedroom 12

---

## **KITCHEN (5)**

* Kitchen 18 *(basicFree)*
* Kitchen 19 *(basicFree)*
* Kitchen 12
* Kitchen 14
* Kitchen 20

---

## **LIVING ROOM (5)**

* Living Room 12 *(basicFree)*
* Living Room 16 *(basicFree)*
* Living Room 21 *(basicFree)*
* Living Room 7
* Living Room 15

* Kids Room 4
* Kids Room 5

---

## **CAFE (5)**

* Cafe 1

# ✅ PART 2 — Update Filtering Logic

## **Free Plan**

Show only 10 basic free rooms:

```ts
if (plan === "free") {
  return rooms.filter(r => r.basicFree === true);
}
```

---

## **Artist Plan**

Show basic free rooms + standard rooms:

```ts
if (plan === "artist") {
  return rooms.filter(r => r.basicFree || r.standard === true);
}
```

→ Should total **30 rooms maximum**.

---

## **Designer / Gallery / All-Access Plans**

Show all rooms (standard + premium):

```ts
if (plan === "designer" || plan === "gallery" || plan === "allaccess") {
  return rooms;
}
```

---

## **Admin Bypass**

Admin must always see all rooms:

```ts
if (user.isAdmin) return rooms;
```

---

# ✅ PART 3 — Metadata Structure

Each room should have:

```ts
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  category: string,
  basicFree?: boolean,
  standard?: boolean,
  premium?: boolean,
  imageUrl: string,
}
```

Rooms not in the basic or standard sets default to `premium: true`.

---
