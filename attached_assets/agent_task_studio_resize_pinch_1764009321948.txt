Message for Replit Agent — Task: Studio Resize & Mobile Pinch Upgrade (Week 4 – Task 1)

Hi! Here is the adjusted Studio improvement task based on the current functionality.

The Studio already has:
✔ Full drag movement
✔ Resize from the bottom-right corner
✔ Selection outline

Now we just need to extend and improve the system to complete the UX.

-----------------------------------
🎯 GOAL
-----------------------------------
Upgrade the Studio so that:

1) The artwork can be resized from **all four corners**  
2) Mobile users can **pinch-to-zoom** the artwork  
3) Selection UX is improved (resize handles appear only when selected)  

Everything else (drag, existing resize, placement) already works and should not be changed.

-----------------------------------
1) RESIZE HANDLES ON ALL FOUR CORNERS
-----------------------------------
Add visible resize handles on:

• top-left  
• top-right  
• bottom-left  
• bottom-right  

Behavior:
- Dragging any corner resizes the artwork proportionally (keep aspect ratio).
- Use the same logic as current bottom-right resize.
- Minimum image size to avoid collapsing (optional but recommended).
- Handles visible only when artwork is selected.

-----------------------------------
2) MOBILE PINCH-TO-ZOOM
-----------------------------------
Add 2‑finger pinch gesture support:

- Pinch outward → scale up
- Pinch inward → scale down
- Maintain artwork center relative to gesture origin
- Ensure drag (1‑finger) and pinch (2‑finger) gestures don’t conflict
- Works on iOS + Android mobile browsers

Important:
- Use CSS transforms (`scale`, `translate3d`) for smooth performance.
- Avoid large re-renders inside gesture events.

-----------------------------------
3) SELECTION UX IMPROVEMENT
-----------------------------------
When artwork is selected:
- Show a thin border (same as current)
- Show all 4 resize handles

When clicking outside the artwork:
- Deselect
- Hide resize handles

-----------------------------------
4) DO NOT BREAK EXISTING FEATURES
-----------------------------------
- Existing drag functionality must remain unchanged
- Existing bottom-right resize must still work
- Existing outline on selection should remain
- No breaking of Studio layout or upload logic

-----------------------------------
✅ FINAL EXPECTATION
-----------------------------------
After this task, the Studio should feel complete:

✔ Drag works (already implemented)  
✔ Resize from any corner  
✔ Pinch zoom on mobile  
✔ Smooth gestures  
✔ Clean UX (handles visible only when selected)  

This completes the core Studio interaction experience for Week 4.

Thank you!
