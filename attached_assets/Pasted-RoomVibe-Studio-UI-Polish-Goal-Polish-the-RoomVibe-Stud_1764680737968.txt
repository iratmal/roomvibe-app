RoomVibe Studio UI Polish

Goal
Polish the RoomVibe Studio UI to look cleaner and more consistent, without changing the core layout or logic.

Context
The Studio is already fully functional (scenes, artwork, frames, upload, modals). We only want visual and UX refinements: spacing, alignment, handle styling, hover states, etc. No new features.

Scope

Spacing & alignment

Review Studio main layout (Scenes sidebar, canvas, right panel).

Fix any obvious misalignments, inconsistent paddings/margins, or elements that feel “too tight” or “too far apart”.

Make sure sections in the right panel (artwork info, frame options, actions) have consistent vertical spacing and headings.

Drag handles styling

Update the artwork drag/resize handles on the canvas so they look:

consistent in size

clearly visible on both light and busy backgrounds

They should feel modern and minimal (e.g. small rounded handles, consistent border and shadow), not heavy or distracting.

Buttons & hover states

Ensure main buttons in Studio (e.g. “Upload wall photo”, “View & Buy”, upgrade CTAs) use consistent styles:

same font size

same border-radius

same padding

Add or refine hover / active states so they feel responsive but subtle (no aggressive animations).

Typography consistency

Apply consistent typography for:

section titles (e.g. “Scenes”, “Frame”, “Artwork details”)

body text

Use the same font families, weights and sizes that are already defined in the design system / app theme.

Avoid introducing new fonts; just align with existing ones.

Mobile Studio check

Open the Studio on a typical mobile viewport.

Ensure:

no text is cut off

icons and buttons are tappable (not too small or too close)

vertical spacing between sections is comfortable.

Fix small issues (overlaps, misaligned paddings) without changing the main mobile layout.

Stop Condition

Desktop Studio looks visually cleaner: consistent spacing, aligned sections, polished handles and buttons.

Mobile Studio has no obvious spacing/alignment issues and is comfortable to use.

No core behavior has changed: scenes, drag/resize, frames, modals, uploads and exports all still work exactly as before.

Notes

This is a polish-only task. Do not refactor major layout structures or introduce new complex components.

If something looks ambiguous or design decisions are unclear, keep changes minimal and document what you adjusted.

If more than a few small layout fixes would be needed for a full redesign, stop and briefly describe the current limitations instead of rewriting large sections.
