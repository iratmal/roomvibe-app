# TASK – Extend Studio Side Columns & Keep Export Visible Without Page Scroll

**Goal**
Adjust the layout of the Studio page so that:

1. The **left “Scenes” column** and **right settings/export column** visually extend lower (not cut off near the footer).
2. The **EXPORT section on the right is visible without needing to scroll the whole page** – user should see it in the viewport when working in Studio.
3. Scrolling for long lists (Scenes, Frames, etc.) happens **inside the columns**, not by pushing the whole page toward the footer.

This is a **layout/UX** task for the `/studio` page.

## 1) Main layout: studio area should fill viewport height

On the `/studio` page, ensure that the main Studio content (left scenes column, center room preview, right settings + export) occupies the full available viewport height (minus header and some spacing above footer).

Example structure (pseudo):

```tsx
<div className="studio-layout">
  <Header />
  <main className="studio-main">
    {/* left, center, right columns */}
  </main>
  <Footer />
</div>
```

Update CSS/Tailwind so that:

```css
.studio-main {
  min-height: calc(100vh - var(--header-height) - var(--footer-offset));
  display: flex; /* or grid, depending on current implementation */
}
```

Or Tailwind-equivalent, for example:

```tsx
<main className="flex flex-1 min-h-[calc(100vh-var(--header-height)-var(--footer-offset))]">
  {/* columns */}
</main>
```

Adjust exact values to match existing header/footer heights.

## 2) Left “Scenes” column behaviour

Requirements:

* Left column height should be based on the viewport height, not the content.
* The list of scenes should scroll **inside the column** (internal scroll), not make the full page scroll down to the footer.

Implementation idea:

```tsx
<aside className="h-[calc(100vh-var(--header-height)-var(--footer-offset))] flex flex-col">
  {/* scenes header + filters */}
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
    {/* scenes grid/list */}
  </div>
</aside>
```

This way:

* Header of the scenes column stays fixed at the top of the column.
* Scenes list scrolls independently (`overflow-y-auto`).

---

## 3) Right settings + EXPORT column behaviour

Goal: EXPORT section (Download / High-Resolution Download buttons) should be visible without scrolling the whole page.

Use a vertical flex layout for the right column:

```tsx
<aside className="h-[calc(100vh-var(--header-height)-var(--footer-offset))] flex flex-col">
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
    {/* artwork selector, frame options, controls, etc. */}
  </div>

  <div className="mt-4">
    {/* EXPORT section – Download + High-Resolution Download */}
  </div>
</aside>
```

Key points:

* Right column has `flex flex-col` with a fixed height relative to viewport.
* Upper part (artwork, frame, controls) uses `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` so it scrolls **inside** the column when content is tall.
* EXPORT block is outside the scrollable area, pinned at the bottom of the column, always visible when the Studio is in view.

Optional: If needed, you can also apply `position: sticky; bottom: 0` on the export container to keep it in view within the column.

---

## 4) Footer separation

* Ensure the footer is visually **separate** from the Studio section.
* On desktop viewports, the Studio area (left + center + right columns) should look like a solid block, and the footer should sit **below** with some spacing.
* The columns should not look like they are "touching" the footer.

If necessary, add small margin/padding between the bottom of the Studio container and the footer.

---

## 5) Responsive behaviour

* Apply the new height/flex behaviour starting from desktop breakpoint (e.g. `md:` or `lg:`).
* On mobile, keep the current stacking/scrolling behaviour unless it becomes obviously broken.

Example:

```tsx
<main className="flex flex-col lg:flex-row lg:min-h-[calc(100vh-var(--header-height)-var(--footer-offset))]">
  {/* columns */}
</main>
```

---

## STOP CONDITION

On a typical laptop viewport:

* Left scenes column is taller and shows more rooms, scrolling inside itself when needed.
* Right column shows the EXPORT buttons without scrolling the full page; only inner column scroll is needed.
* Footer appears clearly below the Studio section, with breathing room.

The UX should feel more spacious and professional, without EXPORT being hidden near the footer.
