# TASK – Fix Admin Access (Stop Upgrade Prompts for Admin Accounts)

**Goal:**
Ensure that **admin accounts** can access *all pages, all tools, all rooms, all dashboards, all exports and all restricted features* **without ever being shown an Upgrade Required modal**.

This includes preventing the system from redirecting admin users to:

* Free → Artist upgrade page
* Artist upgrade modal
* Any plan-based locking logic
* Any plan-based filtering of features or rooms

Admin must always have full unrestricted access.

---

# ✅ PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Currently, when logging in with an **admin password / admin account**, the system incorrectly treats the admin as a normal user.

This causes:

* Admin cannot open certain rooms (premium, standard, etc.)
* Admin gets redirected to pricing pages
* Admin gets “Upgrade to Artist / Designer / Gallery” popups
* Admin is blocked from reviewing full Studio features

This must be permanently fixed.

---

# ✅ PART 1 — Add `isAdmin` Flag to User Session

If not already present, add a boolean flag:

```ts
user.isAdmin === true
```

This can come from:

* database user object, or
* environment variable logic, or
* a dedicated admin email list, or
* existing role logic

(Use whichever method already exists or is simplest to integrate.)

---

# ✅ PART 2 — ADMIN BYPASSES ALL PLAN CHECKS

Wherever the app checks plan limitations (studio access, premium rooms, exports, designer tools, gallery tools, exhibitions, etc.), modify the logic so:

```ts
if (user.isAdmin) return true;
```

Meaning: **admin always has access**.

Apply this to:

* `canAccessRoom` logic
* `canExport` logic
* `canUseDesignerTools`
* `canUseGalleryTools`
* `canViewPremiumRooms`
* exhibition creation
* PDF export limits
* upgrade modal triggers

Admin should be treated the same as an All-Access user, but without any limits.

---

# ✅ PART 3 — DISABLE UPGRADE MODAL FOR ADMINS

Inside the Upgrade Required modal trigger logic, add:

```ts
if (user.isAdmin) return null; // or skip modal entirely
```

Admin must **never** see:

* Upgrade prompt
* Locked icons
* Redirect to pricing
* Stripe flow

---

# ✅ PART 4 — FULL ACCESS TO ALL ROOMS

Admin account should:

* see **all rooms** (Free + Standard + Premium + Future packs)
* never have filtering applied based on plan
* never have rooms locked

Implement:

```ts
if (user.isAdmin) {
  return allRooms; // bypass filtering
}
```

---

# ✅ PART 5 — FULL ACCESS TO DASHBOARDS

Admin must be able to open:

* Artist dashboard
* Designer dashboard
* Gallery dashboard
* All-Access dashboard

without redirects or limitations.

If any dashboard component checks the plan:

```ts
if (user.isAdmin) return true;
```

---

# ✅ PART 6 — TEST CASES

### Test Case 1: Admin enters Studio

* Should see *all rooms*
* No upgrade modal
* No locked features
* Export visible and usable

### Test Case 2: Admin opens Designer Tools

* Should open normally
* No prompts

### Test Case 3: Admin opens Gallery Tools

* Should open normally
* Exhibitions unlimited

### Test Case 4: Admin accesses premium rooms

* All visible, clickable, no restrictions

### Test Case 5: Admin does a hard refresh / new login

* Still no upgrade prompts

---

# MODE PREFERENCE

**Fast Mode** – small logic fixes across feature gating functions.

---

# STOP CONDITION

* Admin can navigate anywhere without seeing any upgrade prompts.
* Admin has full access to all features and data.
* Admin is never redirected to `/pricing` or any upgrade flow.
