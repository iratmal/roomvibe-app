Designer Dashboard UI Polish (Safe, Front-End Only)

IMPORTANT:
👉 Do all changes ONLY in the roomvibe-dev Repl.
👉 Do NOT modify the stable production Repl.
(This is a UI-only task, no backend logic changes.)

Goal

Improve the visual design and UX layout of the Designer Dashboard to align with the RoomVibe brand and premium look.
This is a front-end only task (React + Tailwind).
Do NOT change any backend behavior.

Scope — Implement ALL of the following UI improvements
🔹 1. Top section (“Designer Dashboard”) visual improvement

Increase spacing above/below the main header.

Add a small descriptive subtitle under the header:
“Create client projects and generate room visualizations.”

Make the header font-size slightly larger and more prominent (Inter / semibold).

Optional: add a very light warm-grey background behind the top section (e.g. #f7f8fa).

🔹 2. “Create New Project” card

Replace the current plain white block with a premium card design:

Increase padding (e.g. p-8).

Add rounded corners (rounded-2xl).

Add a soft shadow (shadow-lg shadow-slate-200).

Add subtle light background (e.g. bg-white).

Add icons inside or beside input fields (optional, but desirable):

Project Title → 📁

Client Name → 👤

Room Type → 🏡

Notes → 📝

On desktop: show Project Title and Client Name on the same row.

Make Create Project button full-width on mobile and centered on desktop.

Improve the layout so that the card visually feels like a “workspace tool”.

🔹 3. Empty state for “My Projects”

Current state is too empty.

Replace with:

A centered empty-state illustration (simple SVG placeholder).

Text:
“You don’t have any projects yet.”
“Create your first project above to organize your client work.”

Light grey background or soft padding to visually separate this part.

This is only styling — do NOT add project features or logic.

🔹 4. Designer Account section (bottom left)

Improve the card visually:

Make the card smaller and cleaner

Change background to a lighter neutral (e.g. bg-slate-50)

Add icon/avatar outline at the top left (optional)

Title on top: “Account Details”

Better spacing

Rounded corners (rounded-xl)

Use RoomVibe color palette for text (navy #283593)

🔹 5. Change Password card (bottom right)

Improve consistency:

Increase padding

Rounded corners (rounded-xl)

Add lock icons to password fields (optional)

Add small helper text under the card title:
“Update your password to keep your account secure.”

6. Brand Consistency

Apply the following consistent styles (already used in the Artist dashboard):

Inter font everywhere (matching brand identity)

Consistent heading sizes (H1/H2/H3)

Use RoomVibe primary color #283593 for buttons, headers, links

Use soft-grey neutrals for backgrounds: #f7f8fa / #f5f6f8

Ensure spacing and paddings match the Artist dashboard style

7. NO changes to logic

DO NOT modify:

Project creation logic

API calls

Authentication

Database

Routing

Anything involving backend

This task is strictly UI polish.

Stop condition

The Designer Dashboard should visually match the premium style of the Artist dashboard:

Modern, clean, minimal

Better spacing

Better card layouts

Pleasant empty state

Overall more professional designer-friendly look

All functionality must remain identical.
