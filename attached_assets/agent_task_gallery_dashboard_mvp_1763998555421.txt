Message for Replit Agent — Task: Gallery Dashboard MVP (Collections & Exhibitions)

Hi! Now that the Artist and Designer dashboards are in place, we’d like to implement the Gallery Dashboard MVP.

The gallery role is meant for art galleries that want to present their collection and exhibitions digitally and, later, connect to RoomVibe visualizations.

-----------------------------------
🎯 GOAL
-----------------------------------
On /dashboard/gallery, a gallery user should be able to:

• Create and manage “Collections / Exhibitions”
• Upload artworks into a collection
• See a list of collections and artworks
• Control basic visibility (Published / Draft)
• Delete collections and artworks

This is MVP – simple structure, no public gallery pages yet.

-----------------------------------
1) ROUTING
-----------------------------------
- /dashboard/gallery → Gallery Dashboard
- /dashboard/gallery/collection/:id → Collection Detail View

Access:
- Only users with role = gallery (and admin impersonation).

-----------------------------------
2) DATA MODEL
-----------------------------------

GalleryCollection:
- id
- galleryId (FK to user)
- title
- subtitle (optional)
- description (optional)
- status ("draft" | "published")
- createdAt
- updatedAt

GalleryArtwork:
- id
- collectionId (FK to GalleryCollection)
- title
- artistName
- imageUrl
- widthValue (number)
- heightValue (number)
- dimensionUnit ("cm" | "in")  // same approach as Artist
- priceAmount (optional)
- priceCurrency (optional, default "EUR")
- buyUrl (optional)
- createdAt

-----------------------------------
3) GALLERY DASHBOARD UI
-----------------------------------

Route: /dashboard/gallery

A) Header
“Gallery Dashboard”
“Create digital collections and exhibitions for your gallery.”

B) Create New Collection (form)
Fields:
- Title (required)
- Subtitle (optional)
- Description (optional textarea)
- Status (select: Draft / Published)

Button: Create Collection

After submit:
- Save collection
- Clear form
- Add to list
- Show success toast

C) My Collections (list)
Each collection card shows:
- Title
- Subtitle
- Status (Draft/Published)
- Number of artworks
- Created date

Buttons:
- View Collection
- Delete (with confirmation)

-----------------------------------
4) COLLECTION DETAIL VIEW
-----------------------------------

Route: /dashboard/gallery/collection/:id

A) Collection header
Display:
- Title
- Subtitle
- Status (with a small badge)
- Description
- Created/Updated timestamps

Add a small inline control to change Status:
- Dropdown or toggle: Draft / Published
- Save button

B) Add Artwork to Collection (form)
Fields:
- Title (required)
- Artist Name (required)
- Artwork Image (file upload, jpg/png)
- Width (number)
- Height (number)
- Unit select: cm / in (default cm)
- Price (optional)
- Currency select (EUR [default], USD, GBP)
- Buy URL (optional, full URL for external sales page)

Button:
- Add Artwork

After submit:
- Save artwork
- Clear form
- Add artwork to list
- Show success toast

C) Artworks in this Collection (list/grid)
For each artwork show:
- Thumbnail
- Title
- Artist name
- Dimensions + unit (e.g. 70 × 100 cm)
- Optional price + currency
- Optional “View & Buy” button if buyUrl exists (opens in new tab)

Action:
- Delete Artwork (with confirmation)

-----------------------------------
5) BACKEND / API
-----------------------------------

Collections:
- GET /api/gallery/collections
- POST /api/gallery/collections
- PUT /api/gallery/collections/:id   // for updating status, title, etc.
- DELETE /api/gallery/collections/:id

Artworks:
- GET /api/gallery/collections/:id/artworks
- POST /api/gallery/collections/:id/artworks
- DELETE /api/gallery/artworks/:id

All endpoints must be scoped to the logged-in gallery user (and admin impersonation).

-----------------------------------
✅ FINAL GOAL
-----------------------------------
After this task, when I log in as a Gallery (or Admin impersonating Gallery), I should be able to:

✔ Create a collection/exhibition
✔ See all my collections on /dashboard/gallery
✔ Open a collection detail page
✔ Upload artworks into a collection
✔ See artworks listed with image, basic info, and optional price/buy link
✔ Change collection status Draft/Published
✔ Delete artworks and collections

This completes the Gallery Dashboard MVP and aligns it with the Artist and Designer roles.

Thank you!
