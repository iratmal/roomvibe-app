Message for Replit Agent — FIX: Role Dashboards & Admin Redirect (Artist/Designer/Gallery)

Hi! I tested the new dashboards and here is the current behavior:

- When I go to:
    app.roomvibe.app/#/dashboard/artist
    app.roomvibe.app/#/dashboard/designer
    app.roomvibe.app/#/dashboard/gallery

  I am ALWAYS redirected back to the Admin Dashboard at:
    app.roomvibe.app/#/dashboard

- I am logged in as the admin user (role = admin).

This means I currently cannot see or test the Artist / Designer / Gallery dashboards at all.

-----------------------------------
WHAT I EXPECT INSTEAD
-----------------------------------

From the previous tasks, the intended behavior is:

1. There are FOUR (plus admin) distinct dashboards:
   - User Dashboard       → /dashboard         (for role = "user")
   - Artist Dashboard     → /dashboard/artist
   - Designer Dashboard   → /dashboard/designer
   - Gallery Dashboard    → /dashboard/gallery
   - Admin Dashboard      → /dashboard/admin   (for role = "admin")

2. As ADMIN I should be able to:
   - See my Admin Dashboard at /dashboard/admin
   - Use an impersonation / “view as” mechanism to preview:
       • Artist Dashboard
       • Designer Dashboard
       • Gallery Dashboard
       • User Dashboard
   - NOT be auto-redirected back to /dashboard (Admin) every time I manually open /dashboard/artist, /dashboard/designer or /dashboard/gallery.

Right now route guards / redirects are too strict and always send me back to the admin dashboard.

-----------------------------------
WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED
-----------------------------------

A) ROUTING & ROLE CHECKS

1. Please make sure the routes exist as separate components:
   - /dashboard            → UserDashboard
   - /dashboard/artist     → ArtistDashboard
   - /dashboard/designer   → DesignerDashboard
   - /dashboard/gallery    → GalleryDashboard
   - /dashboard/admin      → AdminDashboard

2. Route guards:

   - If logged-in user has:
        role = "user"      → can access /dashboard      (UserDashboard)
        role = "artist"    → can access /dashboard/artist
        role = "designer"  → can access /dashboard/designer
        role = "gallery"   → can access /dashboard/gallery
        role = "admin"     → can access ALL of the above + /dashboard/admin

   - Admin should NOT be forcibly redirected away from /dashboard/artist, /dashboard/designer or /dashboard/gallery.
     Admin must be allowed to open and see those views for testing.

B) ADMIN IMPERSONATION / VIEW AS

If you have not yet implemented the “View as Role” buttons, please add a simple version now:

1. In Admin Dashboard, inside the “Administrator Account” section, add buttons:
   - “View as User”
   - “View as Artist”
   - “View as Designer”
   - “View as Gallery”
   - “Back to Admin”

2. When admin clicks one of these:
   - Set a temporary session/local state, e.g. impersonatedRole = "artist" (or user/designer/gallery)
   - Redirect to the corresponding dashboard route.
   - Show a small banner at the top:
       “You are viewing as: [Role] (Admin impersonation)”
       + a “Back to Admin” button.

3. “Back to Admin”:
   - clears impersonatedRole
   - redirects to /dashboard/admin

C) NO REDIRECT LOOP

Please remove or adjust any global redirect that forces:
   /dashboard/* → /dashboard   when role = admin.

Admin must be able to open each dashboard route to see what normal users of that role will see.

-----------------------------------
GOAL
-----------------------------------

After this fix:

- /dashboard/admin → Admin Dashboard (for admin role)
- Admin can click buttons to preview User / Artist / Designer / Gallery dashboards.
- Admin can ALSO manually open /dashboard/artist, /dashboard/designer, /dashboard/gallery without being pushed back to admin.
- Normal users still see ONLY their own dashboard and are blocked from others.

Thank you!
