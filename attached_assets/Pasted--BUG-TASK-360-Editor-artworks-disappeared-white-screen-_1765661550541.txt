🚨 BUG TASK — 360° Editor: artworks disappeared + white screen on upload (STAGING)
Context

After recent changes to galleries, no artworks load in 360° Editor scenes.
When trying to upload any image to a wall slot, the editor goes white / crashes and UI disappears or shifts.

Environment: staging.roomvibe.app
Page: /#/gallery/exhibitions/.../360-editor
Gallery template: Classic Gallery (dropdown)

✅ Expected behavior

Existing saved scenes should load with their artworks visible on wall slots.

Uploading / assigning an artwork to a wall slot should not crash.

After upload/assign, artwork should render in the slot and remain after refresh.

UI should remain stable (no white screen, no layout break).

🧩 Steps to reproduce (agent should confirm)

Open 360° Editor → Classic Gallery

Select any wall slot (e.g. North Wall - 1)

Try to upload/assign an image

Observe: screen becomes white and editor UI disappears / shifts

Refresh page → still no artworks visible

🔍 Debug checklist (what to investigate)

Console errors on load and on upload

screenshot or copy stack trace

Network calls (upload endpoint, scene load endpoint)

failing request? 4xx/5xx? CORS? payload too big?

Scene data integrity

did recent gallery template changes break the schema?

are slot IDs changed (North Wall - 1 etc.) so mappings don’t match saved data?

Render pipeline / texture loading

upload returns URL but renderer fails to load texture?

null/undefined artwork URL causes crash

State reset / route remount

on upload, does it navigate / rerender whole app and lose left sidebar state?

🛠️ Fix requirements

Add defensive guards in 360 renderer:

if artwork URL missing/invalid → skip rendering instead of crashing

Ensure slot mapping is backward compatible:

if gallery template changed, migrate/normalize existing scene slot IDs

Make upload/assign flow atomic:

update DB → return stable artwork URL → update client state → render

Add error handling UI:

if upload fails → show toast/error, keep editor visible

✅ Acceptance criteria

Can load existing scenes and see artworks again (at least 1 confirmed scene)

Can upload/assign an artwork to any wall slot without white screen/crash

After save + refresh, artwork remains visible

No console errors during normal use (or at least no fatal render crash)

Priority

P0 – blocks virtual exhibitions + gallery templates
