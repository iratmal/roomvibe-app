🎨 360° VIRTUAL EXHIBITION – REALISM & NAVIGATION UPGRADE (TASK V2)

(copy / paste for Replit Agent)

1) Real Artwork Dimensions (CRITICAL)

Implement correct physical scaling based on artwork dimensions (cm → meters).
All images must appear in their true aspect ratios and relative sizes.

2) Wider Walls (x2)

Expand all wall planes to at least double their current width.
This prevents the camera from “falling off” edges and creates a real gallery feel.

3) Camera Limits (No Sky / No Floor View)

Add pitch constraints so camera cannot tilt into ceiling void or floor void.
Allow rotation within natural gallery viewing angles only.

4) Realistic Gallery Lighting

Replace current flat lighting with:

Soft ambient base light

Spotlights above each artwork (slight cone spread)

Gentle halo on the wall behind artworks (museum effect)

Warm tone lighting (temperature ~3500–4000K)

5) Frames + Shadows

Add realistic:

Thin frames (black or white, ~2–3 cm real-world thickness)

Slight offset from wall (1–2 cm)

Soft wall shadow behind frame

This removes the “sticker on wall” effect.

6) Street-View Navigation

Replace the current movement UI with:

Floor hotspots → click to move

Smooth lerp camera transitions

Soft ease-in / ease-out animation

Optional small directional arrows, but floor hotspots are primary

Goal: movement identical to Artplacer 360° examples.

7) Better Materials

Update:

Ceiling: add gallery-style beams or track lighting rails

Floor: polished concrete or gallery wood (PBR texture)

Walls: subtle texture (not pure flat gray)

8) Remove Auto-Selected Artwork

Currently one artwork is always highlighted.
Remove default selection → highlight only on user click.

9) Update Collection Cards

In Gallery Dashboard:

Add Edit button

Replace yellow “Virtual Room” with “Virtual Exhibition”

This button opens the 360° Editor

10) Fix Artwork Placement Proportions

Some paintings appear distorted (square artworks shown as rectangles, etc.).
Ensure the plane mesh scales correctly based on original image dimensions.
