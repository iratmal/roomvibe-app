Task: Modern Gallery – visual style upgrade using ArtSteps as reference

I’ve attached 2–3 screenshots from an exhibition on ArtSteps.
Please use them as a visual reference only (do NOT copy their assets or room layout) and update our “Modern Gallery” 360° room to achieve a similarly realistic, premium look.

1. Fix current bug

Right now all artworks appear as solid black rectangles in the Modern Gallery editor.

First, fix this so artworks render correctly again (correct texture loading, materials, and aspect ratios).

2. Visual realism & atmosphere (match the reference vibe)

Walls: soft, slightly warm white/grey, with subtle shading – no flat “cartoon” surfaces.

Floor: realistic material (wood or concrete, depending on what’s easier), with visible but subtle texture, like in the ArtSteps screenshots.

Ceiling: add simple but elegant beams/panels and track lighting, inspired by the reference images (again, not copying 1:1, just the feeling).

Lighting: soft, gallery-style lighting with:

gentle wall falloff,

individual light spots above artworks,

no harsh shadows or over-dark corners.

Frames: keep our simple frames, but make sure they feel integrated into the wall (slight shadow, correct thickness).

3. Artwork proportions & wall layout

Make sure artworks keep their correct aspect ratio based on their original width/height.

Avoid stretching.

The main wall should be wider, so 3–4 artworks can breathe (similar spacing as in the reference gallery).

Camera height should feel like a person standing (~1.6–1.7 m), so artworks are at natural eye level.

4. Overall feeling

The gallery should feel like a real, airy space where you could actually walk in — closer to ArtSteps realism and further away from a “flat cartoon” look.

Keep performance in mind (low-poly where possible), but prioritize a polished, professional impression.

When you’re done, please:

enable the Modern Gallery in the 360° editor for testing, and

confirm what exactly you changed (materials, lighting setup, camera, walls, etc.).
