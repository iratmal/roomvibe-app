🧩 TASK 3 – Category linkovi iznad scena (Bathroom, Bedroom, Café, Kids, Kitchen, Living)

Goal:
Add a simple category navigation above the scenes list in RoomVibe Studio so that the user can quickly jump between room types: Bathroom, Bedroom, Café, Kids Room, Kitchen, Living Room.
Scenes in the left sidebar should be grouped by category and still scrollable, but navigation links allow fast access to each group.

Context

Screen: RoomVibe Studio (route /studio)

Layout:

Left: list of Scenes (room thumbnails) – currently one long list.

Center: room preview.

Right: artwork/frame panel.

Desired UX:

Above the scenes list (below the “RoomVibe Studio · Upload a wall photo” header), there should be a horizontal row of category links/pills:

All

Bathroom

Bedroom

Café

Kids Room

Kitchen

Living Room

Below those links the scenes remain in a single scrollable list but are grouped by category so the user can visually see which scenes belong to which type.

Clicking a category link:

scrolls the scenes list to the first room of that category (smooth scroll),

OR filters the list to show only that category — whichever is simpler/cleaner to implement, but keep behaviour consistent.

Scope – do ONLY this

Ensure rooms have a category field

In the rooms data model (e.g. src/data/rooms.ts or similar), ensure that each room has a category property that maps to one of:

"bathroom"

"bedroom"

"cafe"

"kids"

"kitchen"

"living"

If categories already exist in a different form (e.g. type), reuse them – don’t introduce duplicate fields if not needed.

Add category navigation UI above scenes

In the component that renders the scenes sidebar (e.g. StudioScenesSidebar.tsx or similar), add a horizontal list of clickable category pills/links right above the scenes grid/list.

Labels to show in the UI:

All

Bathroom

Bedroom

Café

Kids Room

Kitchen

Living Room

Visually keep it in the existing RoomVibe style:

simple text buttons/pills with a subtle active state (e.g. underline or background),

minimalistic, no heavy redesign.

Group scenes by category in the list

Below the category links, render scenes grouped by category.
Example approach:

Optional small heading for each category (e.g. “Bathroom”, “Bedroom”) followed by its scenes.

Or internal grouping used only for scrolling/filtering but still displaying as one list.

Respect existing ordering of scenes within each category.

Implement category behaviour

Default state: All is selected, showing all scenes (grouped, but continuous scroll).

When user clicks a category link:

Option A (preferred if easy): scroll the scenes container to the first scene of that category (smoothly).

Option B: filter the list to show only scenes from that category, with an easy way to go back to All.

Make sure active category is visually highlighted.

Responsive behaviour

On desktop, category links can be in a single row.

On smaller screens, if needed, allow the pill row to scroll horizontally.

Do not break the existing studio layout.

Preserve existing functionality

Clicking a scene must still switch the room as before.

Premium label / section (if exists) should continue to work correctly.

No changes to the center canvas or right panel.

Do NOT

Do not change copy/text elsewhere in the Studio.

Do not touch billing, roles, or navigation outside the Studio page.

Do not refactor unrelated components or state management.

Do not change how artworks are rendered or scaled (that’s covered in a separate task).

Stop condition

The Studio sidebar shows category links above the scenes.

Scenes are logically grouped by category.

Clicking any category link reliably:

either scrolls to that category’s scenes, or

filters the grid to that category,

And the All link restores/view or scrolls to the full list.

All rooms remain selectable and work as before.

Mode preference:
This is a UI layout + small UX improvement → use Fast Mode if available.
