# TASK – Fix Onboarding Checklist Logic & UI (Remove Cross-Out, Make Steps Auto-Complete)

**Goal:**
Improve the onboarding checklist so that items behave like a real progress tracker, not manual toggles. Completed steps should NOT show crossed-out text, should NOT be manually clickable, and must auto-complete based on user actions.

This task corrects UI, UX, and state logic for the onboarding flow on `/onboarding`.

---

## PROBLEMS TO FIX

1. **Checklist items are manually clickable** → They should *not* be. Users should not toggle progress.
2. **Completed items are shown with crossed-out text** → Visually incorrect. Cross-out implies “disabled” or “invalid,” not “completed.”
3. **Checklist is not tied to real user actions** → Uploading artwork does not automatically complete the item.

---

## DESIRED BEHAVIOR

### ✔ Completed steps:

* Show a blue checkmark (as now)
* Keep normal text (no line-through)
* Optional: light background highlight (completed-state)
* **Not clickable**

### ✔ Incomplete steps:

* Empty checkbox icon
* Normal text
* Not clickable (informational only)

### ✔ Steps auto-complete when the user performs actual actions:

* **Step 1: “Upload your first artwork”** → Complete when user uploads at least one artwork.
* **Step 2: “Try the Studio”** → Complete when user opens the Studio at least once.
* **Step 3: “Explore Designer Tools or Gallery Tools (if unlocked)”** → Complete only if the user has a plan that unlocks the tools AND visits that section.
* **Step 4: “Install the widget on your website (optional)”** → Complete when user views or copies widget code.

Checkboxes should reflect real system state, not toggles.

## SCOPE — DO ONLY THIS

### 1. Remove manual toggle behavior

* Replace interactive checkbox elements with **non-clickable status indicators**.
* Ensure clicking the entire row does nothing.
* Status must be controlled only by onboarding state (e.g. DB flag, user progress store, etc.).

### 2. Remove crossed-out (line-through) text

* Eliminate any CSS applying `text-decoration: line-through` or opacity changes.
* Keep text fully readable.

### 3. Apply “completed” visual style

* When step is completed:

  * Show the blue checkmark icon
  * Use subtle highlight background (optional but recommended)
  * Keep text normal weight

### 4. Connect steps with real events

Implement logic so onboarding steps update automatically:

* `hasUploadedArtwork = artworks.length > 0`
* `hasOpenedStudio = true` if user navigated to `/studio`
* `hasExploredTools = true` if user visited Designer or Gallery module AND their plan supports it
* `hasInstalledWidget = true` if user opens the Widget embed page or copies embed code

Store progress in user DB or persistent store already used in onboarding.

### 5. Prevent regressions

* Once a step is marked complete, it should stay complete.
* Do NOT allow user to "unclick" progress.

## TESTING CHECKLIST

### Artist User

* Step 1 completes after first artwork upload.
* Step 2 completes after first Studio visit.
* Step 3 stays incomplete (Artist has no Designer/Gallery tools).
* Step 4 optional.

### Designer User

* Steps 1 & 2 auto-complete normally.
* Step 3 completes after opening Designer Tools.

### Gallery User

* Step 3 completes after opening Gallery Tools.

### All-Access User

* Step 3 completes after opening either Designer or Gallery tools.

### No step crosses out text.

## MODE PREFERENCE

Use **Fast Mode** (UI + small logic adjustments).

---

## STOP CONDITION

* Checklist steps no longer toggle manually.
* No text is crossed out.
* Steps complete only when real actions happen.
* Completed steps have correct visual appearance.
* Onboarding UX feels natural, accurate, and consistent.
