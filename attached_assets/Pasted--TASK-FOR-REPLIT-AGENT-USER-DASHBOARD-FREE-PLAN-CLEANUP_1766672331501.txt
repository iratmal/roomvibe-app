# 🎯 TASK FOR REPLIT AGENT – USER DASHBOARD & FREE PLAN CLEANUP

**Environment:** STAGING ONLY (staging.roomvibe.app)

---

## 1️⃣ USER DASHBOARD – PLAN SECTION FIX

### Problem

User Dashboard trenutno prikazuje **Artist plan content**, što je netočno i zbunjujuće za Free/User plan korisnike.

### Required Fixes

#### A. Plan Label (Top Right)

* ❌ Currently: **Artist**
* ✅ Change to: **User** or **Free Plan**

---

#### B. Plan Status

* ❌ Currently: **Status: Active**
* ✅ Change to: **Status: Free**

---

#### C. Plan Description Text

* ❌ Remove Artist-specific copy:

  > "For artists who want professional mockups and high-quality exports"

* ✅ Replace with Free plan description:

  > **For people trying RoomVibe for the first time.**

---

#### D. Feature List (MOST IMPORTANT)

❌ Remove all Artist plan features:

* Up to 50 artworks
* Premium mockup rooms
* Any mention of high-resolution exports

✅ Replace with EXACT Free plan feature list:

* ✔️ Upload up to **3 artworks** *(no branding)*
* ✔️ Preview artworks in mockup rooms
* ✔️ Embed Studio widget on your website
* ✔️ Buy button integration
* ✔️ **Add up to 7 additional artworks with RoomVibe branding**

👉 IMPORTANT: This wording must be **exact** and unambiguous.

---

#### E. Buttons

* ❌ Remove / hide:

  * “Manage billing”

* ✅ Keep:

  * “View all plans”

---

## 2️⃣ CONSISTENCY CHECKS

Ensure consistency across User Dashboard:

* Account Information → **Plan: Free** (already correct, keep as-is)
* Widget Embed section remains ENABLED for Free users
* Buy Button Integration remains ENABLED for Free users

---

## 3️⃣ NO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES REQUIRED

This task is **UI + copy-only**:

* ❌ No backend changes
* ❌ No database changes
* ❌ No plan logic changes

---

## 4️⃣ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

✅ User Dashboard clearly shows **Free / User plan**
✅ No Artist features visible to User plan
✅ Free plan limits are crystal clear:

* 3 artworks (clean)
* +7 artworks (RoomVibe branded)

---

## 5️⃣ DEPLOYMENT RULE

⚠️ **DO NOT deploy to production**
✔️ Apply changes ONLY to **staging**

---

✅ Once completed, notify for review before moving to Artist Dashboard tasks.

---

🧠 Product intent reminder:
This clarity is critical for trust, onboarding, and conversion.
No hidden limitations, no confusion.

---

**End of task.**
