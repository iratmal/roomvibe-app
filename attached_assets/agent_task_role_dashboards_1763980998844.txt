Message for Replit Agent — Task: Implement Basic Role-Based Dashboards (Artist / Designer / Gallery)

Hi! Here is the second task for today.

TASK: Create basic dashboard placeholders for the three main professional roles:
- Artist
- Designer
- Gallery

These dashboards do not need full functionality yet — just the structure and routing.

Requirements:

1. Routing:
   - /dashboard → automatically load correct dashboard based on user.role
   - /dashboard/artist
   - /dashboard/designer
   - /dashboard/gallery

2. Each dashboard should have:
   - Header: “Artist Dashboard” / “Designer Dashboard” / “Gallery Dashboard”
   - Welcome message (with user email shown)
   - Placeholder cards/buttons for future features:
        Artist:
          - Upload Artwork
          - My Artworks
          - Analytics
        Designer:
          - My Projects
          - Upload Project
          - PDF/Moodboard Export (placeholder)
        Gallery:
          - Upload Collection
          - My Collection
          - Online Exhibition Builder (placeholder)
   - Logout button
   - Clean layout consistent with the User dashboard

3. Role-based access:
   - user.role === "artist" → show Artist Dashboard
   - user.role === "designer" → show Designer Dashboard
   - user.role === "gallery" → show Gallery Dashboard
   - user.role === "user" → standard User Dashboard
   - No unauthorized access (e.g., a user cannot open /dashboard/artist).

4. Admin override (later):
   - Keep structure clean so we can add an Admin panel next week.

Goal:
Have four separate dashboards (User, Artist, Designer, Gallery), each accessible only by the correct role, so we can continue implementing features logically.

Thank you!
