Message for Replit Agent — Task: Artist Website Widget (Embed Code in Artist Dashboard)

Hi! Here is a new task for the Artist role.

Now that the Artist Dashboard and artwork uploads are working, I’d like to add a simple Website Widget section so artists can copy a small embed code and paste it on their own website.

-----------------------------------
🎯 GOAL
-----------------------------------
On the Artist Dashboard (/dashboard/artist), add a new section called “Website Integration / Widget” where the artist can:

- see a short explanation of what the widget does
- copy a small embed code snippet
- (optionally) get a per-artwork widget code later

This is still MVP, so we don’t need full configuration UI – just a clear, working snippet for now.

-----------------------------------
1) LOCATION IN UI
-----------------------------------
On /dashboard/artist:

Under “My Artworks” and the Artist Account section, add a new block:

Title: Website Integration
Subtitle: Add RoomVibe widget to your website so visitors can view your artwork in their own room.

-----------------------------------
2) GLOBAL WIDGET EMBED (MVP)
-----------------------------------
For now, we can keep it simple and generate a global widget code for the artist.

UI:

- Textarea (read-only) with the code snippet
- Button: “Copy Code” (copies full code to clipboard)

Example embed snippet (please adjust to match actual widget implementation):

<!-- RoomVibe – View in Room Widget -->
<script
  src="https://app.roomvibe.app/widget.js"
  data-artist-id="ARTIST_ID_PLACEHOLDER">
</script>

Requirements:

1. Replace ARTIST_ID_PLACEHOLDER dynamically with the logged-in artist’s ID or slug.
2. The widget script (e.g. /widget.js) should:
   - Render a button like “View in Room” or “See in Your Space” on the artist’s site.
   - On click, open RoomVibe Studio (or a modal) with the correct artist context.
3. For now, it’s OK if the widget just opens the generic Studio; later we will extend it to pass specific artwork IDs.

If widget.js is not implemented yet, you can still provide the snippet with a TODO comment so the structure is ready.

-----------------------------------
3) (OPTIONAL – NICE TO HAVE) PER-ARTWORK WIDGET
-----------------------------------
If it’s not too much extra work, please also:

- On each artwork card in “My Artworks”, add a small button: “Get widget code”.
- Clicking it opens a modal with a snippet like:

<!-- RoomVibe – View this artwork in Room -->
<script
  src="https://app.roomvibe.app/widget.js"
  data-artist-id="ARTIST_ID"
  data-artwork-id="ARTWORK_ID">
</script>

- Again, ARTIST_ID and ARTWORK_ID should be filled automatically.

If this is too big for now, we can keep it as a follow-up task. The minimum for this task is the global artist widget in the “Website Integration” section.

-----------------------------------
4) COPY UX
-----------------------------------
- The “Copy Code” button should:
  - copy the full snippet to the clipboard
  - show a small confirmation (toast or text): “Code copied!”

-----------------------------------
✅ GOAL FOR THIS TASK
-----------------------------------
After this task, when I view /dashboard/artist as an Artist (or Admin impersonating Artist), I should see:

- A Website Integration section
- A textarea with a working embed snippet that includes my artist ID
- A Copy Code button that copies the snippet

This will allow me to paste the widget code into my own website (Shopify, WordPress, etc.) so visitors can click “View in Room”.

Thank you!
