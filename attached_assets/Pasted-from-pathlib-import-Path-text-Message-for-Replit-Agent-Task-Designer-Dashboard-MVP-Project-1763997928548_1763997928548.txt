Hi! Here is the next major role task for the RoomVibe application.

We want to implement the Designer Dashboard MVP, allowing interior designers to create projects and upload room images for their clients.

-----------------------------------
🎯 GOAL
-----------------------------------
On /dashboard/designer, designers should be able to:
• Create interior design projects
• View a list of all their projects
• Open a project
• Upload room images for that project
• View/delete images
• Delete projects

This is the MVP stage — simple and functional. “Open in Studio” and “Share with client” will be added later.

-----------------------------------
1) ROUTING
-----------------------------------
- /dashboard/designer → Designer Dashboard
- /dashboard/designer/project/:id → Project Detail View

Access control:
- Only users with role = designer
- Admin impersonation should work normally

-----------------------------------
2) DATA MODEL
-----------------------------------

Project:
- id
- designerId
- title
- clientName (optional)
- roomType (string)
- notes (optional text)
- createdAt
- updatedAt

RoomImage:
- id
- projectId
- imageUrl
- label (optional)
- createdAt

-----------------------------------
3) DESIGNER DASHBOARD UI
-----------------------------------

A) Header
“Designer Dashboard”
“Create projects and upload room visuals for your clients.”

B) Create New Project (form)
Fields:
- Project Title (required)
- Client Name (optional)
- Room Type (optional)
- Notes (optional)

Button:
Create Project

After submit:
- Save project
- Clear form
- Insert into project list
- Show success toast (“Project created successfully!”)

C) My Projects (list)
Each project card shows:
- Title
- Client
- Room Type
- Image count
- Created date

Buttons:
- View Project
- Delete (with confirmation)

-----------------------------------
4) PROJECT DETAIL VIEW
-----------------------------------

Route: /dashboard/designer/project/:id

A) Project header
- Title
- Client
- Room Type
- Notes

B) Upload Room Image
Fields:
- image file (jpg/png)
- label (optional)

Button:
Upload Room Image

After upload:
- Add image to list
- Show success toast
- Stay on same page

C) Room Images list
Each image card shows:
- Thumbnail
- Label
- Delete button

-----------------------------------
5) BACKEND / API
-----------------------------------

Projects:
- GET /api/designer/projects
- POST /api/designer/projects
- DELETE /api/designer/projects/:id

Room Images:
- GET /api/designer/projects/:id/rooms
- POST /api/designer/projects/:id/rooms
- DELETE /api/designer/rooms/:id

All endpoints must be scoped to the logged-in designer (or admin impersonation).

-----------------------------------
✅ FINAL GOAL
-----------------------------------
After this task, when I log in as Designer (or Admin impersonating Designer), I should be able to:

✔ Create a project  
✔ See projects  
✔ Open a project  
✔ Upload room images  
✔ See them in a list  
✔ Delete projects and images  
✔ Stay inside Designer Dashboard for all actions

This completes the Designer Dashboard MVP.

Thank you!
