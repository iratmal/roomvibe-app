Hi! Here is the next task.

We now have basic role dashboards, and I would like to implement the Artist Dashboard MVP so artists can actually upload and manage their artworks.

🎯 GOAL

Create a functional Artist Dashboard where an artist can:

upload artworks (image + basic data)

see the list of their artworks

edit or delete an artwork

have a “View & Buy” URL for each artwork that links to an external shop (Shopify / other)

and use these artworks inside the Studio later (for now, just prepare the structure).

This is still MVP – design can stay simple, but UX should be clear.

1) ROUTING / ACCESS

Route: /dashboard/artist

Only users with role = "artist" (or admin in impersonation mode) can access it.

2) DATA MODEL (MVP LEVEL)

Please create a simple data model for Artwork (table/collection), e.g.:

id

artistId (references the user)

title

imageUrl

width (cm)

height (cm)

price (optional for now)

buyUrl (external link to Shopify / other)

createdAt

updatedAt

For now, this can be as simple as needed – we just need a stable structure.

3) ARTIST DASHBOARD UI – SECTIONS

On /dashboard/artist please include:

A) Header

Title: “Artist Dashboard”

Subtitle: “Upload and manage your artworks.”

B) “Add New Artwork” form

Fields:

Title (text)

Image upload (file)

Width in cm (number)

Height in cm (number)

Price (optional, text or number)

Buy URL (text input for full URL, e.g. Shopify product page)

Buttons:

Save / Upload Artwork

Basic validation (required: title, image, width, height, buyUrl)

After submit:

Upload image

Save artwork record

Show success message

Clear the form.

C) “My Artworks” list

Show a list/table/grid of all artworks for that artist:

For each artwork show:

Thumbnail of the image

Title

Dimensions (e.g. “80 × 100 cm”)

Optional price

The Buy URL (shortened or with a “View & Buy” button)

Actions for each artwork:

Edit (open edit form on the same page or in a modal)

Delete (with a confirmation step)

For the Edit form, allow updating:

Title

Width / Height

Price

Buy URL

(Image upload can be optional – only if user changes it)

4) BACKEND / API

Please add API endpoints for:

GET /api/artist/artworks → list current artist’s artworks

POST /api/artist/artworks → create new artwork

PUT /api/artist/artworks/:id → update artwork

DELETE /api/artist/artworks/:id → delete artwork

These should always be scoped to the logged-in artist (and admin, if impersonating).

5) FUTURE CONNECTION TO STUDIO (for later)

For now, just make sure that:

Artworks can be fetched easily by the system

Data model is clean so later we can plug these artworks into the Studio visualizer.

We don’t need full Studio integration in this task yet, just the management part.

✅ GOAL FOR THIS TASK

After this task, when I log in as an Artist (or as Admin in “view as Artist” mode), I should be able to:

open /dashboard/artist

upload new artworks with images + basic info + Buy URL

see them listed

edit and delete them

Thank you!
