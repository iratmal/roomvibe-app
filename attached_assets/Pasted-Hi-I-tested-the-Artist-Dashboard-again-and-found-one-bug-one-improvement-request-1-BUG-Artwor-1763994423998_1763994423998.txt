Hi! I tested the Artist Dashboard again and found one bug + one improvement request.

1) BUG: Artwork dashboard auto-opens my Buy URL

What happens now:

I added an artwork with a valid Buy URL (link to my product page).

The artwork card shows correctly in “My Artworks”.

But when I refresh /dashboard/artist, the page keeps opening that Buy URL (my product page) automatically, as if something is redirecting or embedding it.

This happens even in a private window, so it’s not cookies/cache.

What I need instead:

The Artist Dashboard should never auto-open the Buy URL on page load or refresh.

The Buy URL should only be used:

as the target of the “View & Buy →” button (open in a new tab target="_blank"),

OR in a small icon/link on the card.

The main dashboard view must always stay on /dashboard/artist unless I explicitly click “View & Buy”.

Please remove any automatic redirect / navigation / iframe that uses the Buy URL on page load.

If it helps:

Check that no window.location = buyUrl or similar is triggered on mount.

The card’s click handler should not redirect the entire page; only the explicit button should open the external link.

2) FEATURE: Dimension units (cm / inches)

Right now, the artwork dimensions are:

Width (cm)

Height (cm)

For international artists and clients, we need support for inches as well.

What I’d like:

Add a Unit selector next to width & height, with options:

cm (default)

in (inches)

Data model:

Store:

widthValue

heightValue

dimensionUnit (string, "cm" or "in")

(If it’s easier for the Studio later, you can internally also store values in cm, but from the UI side I just need to choose and see the correct unit.)

Display in “My Artworks”:

Show dimensions with the chosen unit, for example:

70.00 × 120.00 cm

or 30 × 40 in

This way artists can enter dimensions in the units they normally use.

Goal

The Artist Dashboard should not auto-open any Buy URL on refresh; it should stay on the dashboard and only open links when I click “View & Buy”.

The dimensions section should support both cm and inches, with cm as default.

Thank you!
