Message for Replit Agent — Task: Designer Dashboard MVP (Projects + Room Uploads)

Hi! Here is the next major role task.

We want to implement the Designer Dashboard MVP so interior designers can create projects and upload room images for their clients.

-----------------------------------
🎯 GOAL
-----------------------------------
On `/dashboard/designer`, designers should be able to:

• Create interior design projects  
• Upload room images to each project  
• View all projects  
• View each project individually  
• Delete projects or room images  

This is an MVP – clean design, functional structure, not full moods/PDFs yet.

-----------------------------------
1) ROUTING
-----------------------------------

- `/dashboard/designer` → Designer Dashboard
- `/dashboard/designer/project/:id` → Project Detail View

Access:
- Only `role = designer` (and admin impersonation) can access these pages.

-----------------------------------
2) DATA MODEL (MVP)
-----------------------------------

**Project**
- id
- designerId (FK to user)
- title
- clientName (optional)
- roomType (string)
- notes (optional, text)
- createdAt
- updatedAt

**RoomImage**
- id
- projectId (FK to project)
- imageUrl
- label (optional)
- createdAt

-----------------------------------
3) DESIGNER DASHBOARD UI
-----------------------------------

### A) Header
Title: “Designer Dashboard”
Subtitle: “Create projects and upload room visuals for your clients.”

### B) Create New Project (form)
Fields:
• Project title (required)  
• Client name (optional)  
• Room type (text or dropdown)  
• Notes (optional textarea)

Button: Create Project

After submit:
• Save project  
• Clear form  
• Add it to project list  
• Show success toast  

### C) My Projects (list)
Each project card shows:
• Title  
• Client  
• Room type  
• Image count  
• Created date  

Buttons:
• “View Project”  
• “Delete” (with confirmation)  

-----------------------------------
4) PROJECT DETAIL VIEW
-----------------------------------
Route: `/dashboard/designer/project/:id`

Shows:

### A) Project header
• Title  
• Client  
• Room type  
• Notes  

### B) Upload Room Images
Fields:
• File upload (jpg/png)  
• Label (optional)

Button: Upload Room Image

After upload:
• Add image to room list  
• Show success toast  

### C) Room Images List
Each image shows:
• Thumbnail  
• Label  
• Delete button  

-----------------------------------
5) API ENDPOINTS
-----------------------------------

**Projects**
• GET /api/designer/projects  
• POST /api/designer/projects  
• DELETE /api/designer/projects/:id  

**Room Images**
• GET /api/designer/projects/:id/rooms  
• POST /api/designer/projects/:id/rooms  
• DELETE /api/designer/rooms/:id  

All must be scoped to logged-in designer (and admin impersonation).

-----------------------------------
✅ FINAL GOAL FOR THIS TASK
-----------------------------------

When I open `/dashboard/designer` as a Designer (or Admin impersonating Designer), I can:

• Create a project  
• See projects  
• Open a project  
• Upload room images  
• Delete images  
• Delete projects  

This gives designers a clean, functional space to prepare rooms for future visualization and client presentations.

Thank you!
