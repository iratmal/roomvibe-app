# TASK: Mobile Export Panel Polish (High-Resolution Export + Unlock CTA Fix)

This task fixes UI inconsistencies between desktop vs. mobile for the Export section inside the RoomVibe Studio.  
No logic changes — purely UI corrections for mobile breakpoints.

====================================================================
# 1) ISSUE SUMMARY

On mobile view:

1. The **High-Resolution Download** button is missing the gold border.
2. The **Unlock High-Resolution Export – Upgrade** CTA shows navy text, but  
   → it is missing the gold border (only plain text appears).
3. A **legacy small yellow text line** (“Unlock High-Resolution Export Upgrade”) still appears under the Export section on mobile — this should be completely removed.
4. Desktop styling for export buttons does not fully apply on mobile due to:
   - different component structure OR
   - mobile CSS overrides / missing breakpoints.

Mobile and desktop UI must match 100%.

====================================================================
# 2) REQUIRED FIXES

## FIX A — Restore GOLD border for mobile export buttons

Apply this styling to BOTH buttons on mobile:

```
border: 1.5px solid #D8B46A !important;   /* Gold border */
color: #283593 !important;                /* Navy text */
font-weight: 500 !important;
border-radius: 8px;
padding: 10px 16px;
```

This applies to:

### 1) High-Resolution Download (premium)
### 2) Unlock High-Resolution Export → Upgrade to Designer (locked CTA)

Ensure mobile breakpoints do NOT override borders.

---

## FIX B — Remove legacy yellow-text element on mobile

On some mobile layouts, an older element appears:

`Unlock High-Resolution Export Upgrade` (small yellow font)

This must be **completely removed** for all breakpoints.

Action:

- Locate the legacy `<p>`, `<small>` or helper `<span>`  
- Remove entirely OR conditionally hide:

```
display: none !important;
```

Stop showing this element anywhere in the new UI.

---

## FIX C — Match desktop spacing and hierarchy on mobile

Apply consistent layout:

### Spacing rules:
```
margin-top: 16px;
margin-bottom: 12px;
button spacing: 12px between buttons;
```

### Typography rules:
```
font-size: 14px;
font-weight: 500;
line-height: 1.35;
```

### Export section header:
Ensure “EXPORT” label is visible and correctly spaced.

---

## FIX D — Ensure layout order is identical to desktop:

Correct order on mobile must be:

1. EXPORT (section label)
2. Download (regular)
3. High-Resolution Download (premium / locked)
4. PDF Export
5. Unlock Premium CTA (if locked)
6. View & Buy button

Nothing should be duplicated or reordered.

---

====================================================================
# 3) CSS TARGETING GUIDELINES

### Mobile breakpoint:
Use same breakpoint as rest of the app:

```
@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }
```

Inside that scope:

- Reapply gold border  
- Reapply navy text  
- Remove legacy elements  
- Normalize spacing  

Ensure the mobile component is not using stale or fallback CSS inherited from older export panel versions.

---

====================================================================
# 4) STOP CONDITIONS

Mobile export panel is considered complete when:

✓ High-Resolution Download button has gold border + navy text  
✓ Unlock High-Resolution CTA has gold border + navy text  
✓ No yellow-text legacy lines remain visible anywhere  
✓ Buttons are readable, consistent, and match desktop styling  
✓ Button spacing is correct  
✓ Entire mobile export panel visually matches the desktop design system  
✓ No duplicated or outdated elements appear  

---

====================================================================
# 5) NOTES

- This task must NOT alter the logic of export, feature locking, or entitlements.  
- Pure UI polish only.  
- Desktop version must remain unchanged — only mobile fixes should apply.
