# 1) NEW LOGIC FOR FREE / BASIC / PRO USERS

### FREE USER

* **Download** → LOW-RES + WATERMARK
* **High-Resolution Download** → LOCKED → Show Upgrade modal
* **PDF Export** → LOCKED
* CTA “Unlock all features – Upgrade” must be clearly visible as a clickable link/button.

### BASIC USER

* **Download** → NO WATERMARK
* **High-Resolution Download** → LOCKED (unless later configured differently)
* **PDF Export** → NO WATERMARK

### PRO USER

* **Download** → NO WATERMARK
* **High-Resolution Download** → NO WATERMARK (full size)
* **PDF Export** → NO WATERMARK

---

# 2) BUTTON RENAMING (MANDATORY)

Old Label → New Label

* “Preview” → **“Download”**
* “High-Res” → **“High-Resolution Download”**
* “Export as PDF” → **“PDF Export”**

---

# 3) ADD DOWNLOAD ICONS

Use a standard outline icon (lucide-react Download or similar):

* size: **18px**
* stroke-width: **1.75px**
* color: matches button text color
* icon placement: **left of text**
* spacing between icon & text: **6–8 px**

---

# 4) BUTTON STYLING (TAILWIND/CSS)

### **Download button**

* border: `1.5px solid #283593`
* text color: `#283593`
* padding: `px-4 py-2`
* radius: `8px`
* background: white
* hover: `rgba(40,53,147,0.06)`

### **High-Resolution Download (Pro feature)**

* border: `1.5px solid #D8B46A`
* text color: `#D8B46A`
* padding: `px-4 py-2`
* radius: `8px`
* background: white
* hover: `rgba(216,180,106,0.10)`
* if user IS NOT PRO → clicking triggers Upgrade modal

### **PDF Export**

* text-only button
* text color: `#283593`
* hover underline
* no border

---

# 5) CAPTION TEXT UNDER EACH BUTTON

Add a small, subtle caption (font-size: 12px, color: #666):

### For Download:

```
(1200 px · no watermark for paid plans)
```

### For High-Resolution Download:

```
(3000 px · no watermark · Pro feature)
```

### For PDF Export:

```
(Printer-ready quality)
```

Caption appears directly beneath each button.

---

# 6) UPGRADE CTA FIX

Replace current yellow text with a proper clickable CTA.

### Option A — blue link:

* text: **“Unlock High-Resolution Export → Upgrade”**
* color: `#283593`
* font-weight: 600
* underline on hover

### Option B — small outlined button:

* border: `1.5px solid #D8B46A`
* text color: `#D8B46A`
* padding: `4px 10px`
* radius: `6px`

Either option must look clearly clickable and intentional.

---

# 7) FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

* No watermark for ANY paid user in Download.
* High-Resolution Download only for PRO plan (or plan-based logic).
* Watermark + low-res ONLY for Free plan.
* Upgrade modal must appear for Free/Basic when clicking Pro-only buttons.
* All export logic must work identically on mobile and desktop.

---

# 8) STOP CONDITION

✓ Buttons show new names
✓ Icons appear on all download buttons
✓ Captions appear under each button
✓ Watermark logic correct: Free → watermark; Paid → no watermark
✓ High-res restricted properly
✓ PDF export styled correctly
✓ Upgrade CTA redesigned and clickable
✓ Sidebar layout not broken
✓ Mobile + desktop tested and working

---

# 9) NOTES

* Do NOT refactor unrelated files.
* Do NOT change export resolution unless required.
* Keep all changes minimal and isolated.
* Follow brand colors:

  * Blue: `#283593`
  * Gold: `#D8B46A`
