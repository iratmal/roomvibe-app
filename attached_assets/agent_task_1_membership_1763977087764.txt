Message for Replit Agent — Task #1 (Membership System)

Hi! Here is Task #1 for today.

TASK: Implement basic membership system (Register + Login + Roles)

Requirements:
1. Create user registration form (email + password)
2. Create login form
3. Add email confirmation (basic implementation)
4. Add roles:
   - user
   - artist
   - designer
   - gallery
   - admin
5. After login, redirect user to basic dashboard screen depending on their role.
6. Make sure authentication persists across sessions.
7. Create protected routes based on role (only admin sees admin pages, etc.)

Goal:
Have a working system where users can create an account, log in, and be assigned a role. A simple placeholder dashboard for each role is enough for now.

Thank you!
