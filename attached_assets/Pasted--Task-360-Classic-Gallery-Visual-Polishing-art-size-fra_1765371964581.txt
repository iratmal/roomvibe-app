**Task: 360° Classic Gallery – Visual Polishing (art size, frames, navigation)**

Hi! 👋

The 360° Classic Gallery is now stable and rendering artworks correctly. Thank you for that – it’s a huge relief. 🙌 Now we want to polish the *visuals* of this one gallery space before cloning it into other gallery styles.

Below is a focused polishing task based on the current live state (screenshots sent in the chat).

---

## GOALS

1. **Artworks should feel like real paintings on a gallery wall**, not stickers:

   * Correct relative sizes between artworks are already good ✅
   * But all artworks are currently too small in relation to the wall/room
   * They also lack frames or depth, so they look like flat decals

2. **Movement should feel more like a 3D gallery / street-view style experience**:

   * Viewer should feel like they are *standing in the room* and moving between a few key spots

3. **This should all stay within the existing Classic Gallery preset**:

   * Don’t break existing slot IDs or API contract
   * Keep current layout logic, just visually improve

---

## 1) Artwork Size vs Room (Global Scale)

**Problem now:**

* The relative proportions between artworks look correct (square vs vertical vs horizontal ✅), but all paintings are too small compared to the wall and room.
* From the default "Center" view, they look like A4 posters in a giant hall.

**What we want:**

* Increase the *global* artwork scale so that paintings look like realistic gallery sizes.
* Keep the **relative** size logic (based on real-world width/height or aspect ratio) exactly as it is now.

**Implementation direction:**

* In the part of the code where you convert artwork dimensions / aspect ratio into world units (very likely in `Gallery360Scene`, `ArtworkImage`, or the slot config), add a global scale multiplier, for example:

```ts
const ARTWORK_GLOBAL_SCALE = 1.6; // tweak value until it looks right

const widthWorld  = baseWidthWorld  * ARTWORK_GLOBAL_SCALE;
const heightWorld = baseHeightWorld * ARTWORK_GLOBAL_SCALE;
```

* The exact value is up to you, but visually we want something like this:

  * From the `Center` viewpoint, a 100×100cm painting should look like a **dominant object on the wall**, not a tiny square.
  * Horizontals and verticals must keep their correct proportions and not be squashed.

* Please keep this:

  * ✅ Relative sizing between artworks (already correct)
  * ❌ Do **not** hardcode anything specific for my artworks; this must work generically for any uploaded painting.

If helpful, you can add a temporary debug overlay (or console logs) to confirm the final world size in meters for a few artworks.

## 2) Frames & Depth (No More “Stickers”)

**Problem now:**

* Artworks are rendered as flat planes on the wall.
* They visually read as stickers or decals, not framed canvas.

**What we want:**

* A simple, clean **frame + canvas depth** so it feels like a real painting:

  * Thin frame around the artwork
  * 3D depth (a few cm) so the painting stands slightly off the wall
  * Subtle shadow on the wall from the frame

**Implementation direction:**

In the component where you render the artwork (likely `ArtworkImage`):

1. **Add a shallow box for the canvas** behind the image plane:

```tsx
// Pseudo-code
const FRAME_DEPTH = 0.04; // 4 cm
const CANVAS_OFFSET_FROM_WALL = 0.02; // 2 cm

<group position={[0, 0, CANVAS_OFFSET_FROM_WALL]}>
  {/* Canvas body */}
  <mesh>
    <boxGeometry args={[widthWorld, heightWorld, FRAME_DEPTH]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial
      color="#f5f5f5" // subtle off-white canvas edge
      roughness={0.9}
      metalness={0.0}
    />
  </mesh>

  {/* Image plane on top of canvas */}
  <mesh position={[0, 0, FRAME_DEPTH / 2 + 0.001]}>
    <planeGeometry args={[widthWorld * 0.96, heightWorld * 0.96]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial map={artworkTexture} />
  </mesh>
</group>
```

2. **Add a thin black/dark frame around the canvas**:

   * Either as an inset/outline geometry or a slightly larger box behind the image.

Example idea:

```tsx
const FRAME_THICKNESS = 0.03; // 3 cm border

<mesh>
  <boxGeometry args={[widthWorld + FRAME_THICKNESS, heightWorld + FRAME_THICKNESS, FRAME_DEPTH]} />
  <meshStandardMaterial
    color="#111111"
    roughness={0.4}
    metalness={0.1}
  />
</mesh>
```

3. **Shadows:**

   * Make sure the frame + canvas group `castShadow` and `receiveShadow` are configured so we get a subtle shadow on the wall.

This doesn’t have to be perfect first try – just enough that from the `Center` viewpoint, the artworks clearly look like framed objects, not stickers.

## 3) Movement & Navigation – First Step Toward "Street View"

We *don’t* want to implement full free-fly movement yet, but we want a more natural navigation feeling, closer to ArtSteps or Google Street View.

**Current behavior:**

* We already have the 4 main camera presets: `Entrance`, `Center`, `Back Left`, `Back Right`.
* Movement is done via the buttons at the bottom.

**What we’d like to add now (minimal first version):**

* **Floor markers / hotspots** that represent these 4 camera positions.
* When user clicks a floor marker, the camera jumps to the corresponding preset (same as clicking the buttons).

**Implementation direction:**

* Create a small component, e.g. `GalleryNavigationMarker`, rendered on the floor at the 4 positions that correspond to the existing camera presets.
* Visually, something simple like:

  * A small round disk on the floor (e.g. teal circle) with subtle opacity
  * Always facing up, not affected by camera rotation

Pseudo-code idea:

```tsx
function NavMarker({ position, label, onClick }) {
  return (
    <mesh
      position={position}
      rotation={[-Math.PI / 2, 0, 0]}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      <circleGeometry args={[0.4, 32]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial
        color="#2bb7a9"
        transparent
        opacity={0.65}
      />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```

* For now, hook them directly to the existing camera logic, e.g.:

```tsx
<NavMarker
  position={[xEntrance, 0.01, zEntrance]}
  label="Entrance"
  onClick={() => setActiveView("entrance")}
/>

<NavMarker
  position={[xCenter, 0.01, zCenter]}
  label="Center"
  onClick={() => setActiveView("center")}
/>
// etc.
```

* Make sure markers are only visible in the 360° editor / gallery view, not in other parts of the app.

This gives us the first version of a more immersive, "I walk through the space" feeling without adding complex free-movement controls.

---

## 4) Camera Constraints (Vertical Scrolling)

**Small tweak:**

* When I scroll up/down a lot, the camera can still reach angles where I see too much ceiling or floor.

If it’s not too much trouble in this round, please:

* Clamp the vertical orbit so the user can’t tilt fully up or fully down.
* The viewer should feel like a person standing in the room, roughly 1.6–1.7m tall.

Example idea (depending on your orbit controls):

* Limit polar angle between something like `minPolarAngle = 0.9` and `maxPolarAngle = 2.4` (values to be tuned to your control setup).

---

## 5) What Not to Touch (Yet)

Please **do not** change in this task:

* Artwork loading logic, textures, or CORS setup (this now works, and we have a safe baseline ✅)
* API contracts for exhibitions/artworks
* Wall slot IDs or naming
* Any Phase 2 features (artwork info panel, comments, music, etc.) – we’ll do that in a separate task.

---

## Definition of Done

From the `Classic Gallery` preset in the 360 editor:

* [ ] Artworks look significantly larger and more proportionate to the room, while keeping their relative size differences and aspect ratios.
* [ ] Each artwork clearly looks like a framed object with depth, not a flat sticker.
* [ ] Moving between `Entrance`, `Center`, `Back Left`, and `Back Right` via floor markers feels intuitive.
* [ ] Camera cannot tilt into weird extreme angles that break the illusion of being in a room.
* [ ] No regressions in artwork rendering (images still load correctly).

Thank you! 🙏 Once this Classic Gallery is visually polished and stable, we’ll reuse the same system for additional gallery styles (Industrial, Loft, Modern, etc.) and then move to Phase 2 features (artwork info panels, comments, external purchase links, etc.).
