Message for Replit Agent — Studio Patch: Room 4 Real-Size Fix + Mobile Layout Update

Hi! Great work so far — the Studio, frames and real-size behavior now look very good overall.

There are only TWO remaining issues:

1) Room 4 artwork is still too large compared to the room furniture  
2) On mobile, the Studio layout shows the room list first and the main canvas is pushed below the fold

This file describes both fixes.

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 1 — ROOM 4 REAL-SIZE SCALING (FINAL ADJUSTMENT)
------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
- In Room 4, a 150 × 100 cm artwork still appears too large relative to the sofa and wall.
- All other rooms (1–3, 5–10) look realistic. Only Room 4 feels oversized.

Goal:
- Make Room 4 consistent with the other rooms in terms of real-size perception.

What to do:

1) Re-check the Room 4 wall calibration:
   - Identify the visible main wall area where the artwork hangs.
   - Measure wall width in pixels (the part we are using for placing the artwork).
   - Compare with a realistic real-world wall width.

2) Adjust Room 4 config:
   - Increase the wallWidthCm so that the artwork becomes smaller relative to the wall.
   - Suggested starting point:
       wallWidthCm: 420–450
       wallHeightCm: 260–270
     (You can fine-tune within this range based on your measurements.)

3) Test with these artworks:
   - Artwork A: 100 × 150 cm (portrait)
   - Artwork B: 150 × 100 cm (landscape)

   Expected visual behavior:
   - 100 × 150 cm piece should be slightly taller than the sofa back, not reaching the ceiling.
   - 150 × 100 cm piece should be clearly smaller than the wall width, with comfortable margins on left and right.
   - Proportions should feel similar to the same artworks in Rooms 1–3.

Acceptance criteria:
- When switching between Room 2 and Room 4 with the same artwork and real-size active, the artwork should feel similar in real-world scale.
- No room should make the piece look absurdly larger than the furniture.
- Drag/resize/pinch and frames must continue to work without any changes.

IMPORTANT:
- Please only change the Room 4 wall dimensions and any related scale factor, not the global scaling logic that already works for other rooms.

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 2 — MOBILE LAYOUT UPDATE (STUDIO FIRST, ROOMS BELOW)
------------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
- On mobile, when the user opens the Studio:
  - The first screen shows the list of Scenes (Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, etc.) taking up the whole viewport.
  - The main Studio canvas (Upload wall photo + artwork on wall) is pushed below the fold.
- This is confusing: users expect to immediately see their artwork on the wall, not just the room thumbnails.

Goal:
- On mobile devices, show the Studio canvas first, and move the room list below it.

Desired behavior (mobile only):

1) When opening /studio on mobile:
   - The first thing visible above the fold should be:
     - "RoomVibe Studio" header
     - Upload Wall Photo button
     - Main preview canvas with the current room + artwork

2) The Scenes/Rooms list:
   - Should be displayed BELOW the Studio canvas on mobile.
   - Can be:
       - a horizontal scrollable strip of room thumbnails, OR
       - a vertical list under the canvas.
   - Important: it must not push the entire canvas below the initial viewport.

Implementation suggestion:

- Use a breakpoint for mobile, e.g. max-width: 768px.
- For desktop:
   - Keep current 3-column layout (Rooms | Canvas | Right Panel).
- For mobile:
   - Switch to stacked layout:
       1. Canvas section (including Upload wall photo)
       2. Artwork/Frame controls (right panel content collapsed or as accordion)
       3. Scenes list (room thumbnails) at the bottom

Technical notes:
- You can change flex-direction and ordering for the main layout container on mobile.
- Ensure that:
   - Upload Wall Photo button is easily accessible at the top of the canvas section.
   - Scenes list remains fully functional (tap to change room).
   - No horizontal scroll issues appear.

Acceptance criteria:
- On a phone-width viewport (or real phone), when opening Studio:
   - User immediately sees the artwork on the wall (no scrolling required).
   - Rooms list is visible only after scrolling down.
- Desktop layout remains as it is now (no changes for large screens).

------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL EXPECTATION
------------------------------------------------------------

After these two fixes:

- Room 4 will show correctly scaled artworks, consistent with other rooms.
- Mobile Studio UX will be much clearer:
  - Studio canvas first,
  - Rooms/Scenes list below,
  - Users can instantly see their art on the wall.

Thank you!
