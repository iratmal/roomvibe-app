# RoomVibe Pricing Page – Design & Implementation Brief

**Purpose:**
Replace the current pricing layout with a **clear, human‑friendly, horizontal design** that is easy to understand for non‑technical users (including older artists), while still being professional and SaaS‑grade.

This brief **replaces the existing pricing tables entirely**.

---

## 1. CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)

1. **Clarity over density** – fewer words, stronger hierarchy
2. **Scan‑first design** – users must understand their plan in under 10 seconds
3. **Plain English** – no technical jargon
4. **Two-step understanding**:

   * Step 1: *Which plan is for me?*
   * Step 2: *What exactly do I get compared to others?*

---

## 2. PAGE STRUCTURE (TOP → BOTTOM)

### SECTION 1 — Pricing Plans (Horizontal Layout)

**Layout:**

* Full-width container
* Plans stacked vertically (one block per plan)
* Each plan is a horizontal card with **4 clear columns**:

```
[ Plan Name + Price ] | [ Value Promise ] | [ What You Get ] | [ CTA Button ]
```

---

### SECTION 1A — Plan Block Anatomy (STRICT)

#### Column 1: Plan Header

* Plan name (H3)
* Price (large, bold)
* Billing period (/month)
* Optional tag: "RECOMMENDED" (All‑Access only)

---

#### Column 2: Value & Audience

**A. One‑sentence VALUE PROMISE (bold)**

> This is the most important sentence in the entire block.

**B. Who it’s for (1 short line)**

---

#### Column 3: What You Get (MAX 5 bullets)

Rules:

* Max **5 bullets only**
* Each bullet = **one clear benefit**
* No technical wording
* Numbers always explicit (3, 50, 100, Unlimited)

Optional:

* One highlighted discovery box at the bottom (⭐) if relevant

---

#### Column 4: CTA

* One primary button
* Calm, confident wording
