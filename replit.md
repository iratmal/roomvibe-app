# RoomVibe Studio - Full Application

## Overview
RoomVibe Studio is a comprehensive React/TypeScript web application designed to visualize artwork in various room environments using a Canvy-style three-panel editor. Its core purpose is to allow users to see how artworks would look on their walls, featuring functionalities like true-to-scale sizing and the potential for wall recoloring. The application aims to provide a modern, user-friendly art visualization experience, ready for integration with e-commerce platforms like Shopify. It includes a full-stack authentication system with role-based access control and robust security features.

## User Preferences
I prefer simple language in explanations. I like functional programming paradigms where applicable. I want iterative development, with small, testable changes. Ask before making major architectural changes or introducing new dependencies. I prefer detailed explanations for complex logic. Do not make changes to files in the `public/presets` folder. Do not make changes to the `server.js` file.

## System Architecture
The application is built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Color Scheme**: Primary color is Blue (#8BADE5) with black text.
- **Typography**: Poppins sans-serif for all text, with an increased base font size of 19px.
- **Background**: Canva-style mesh background with blurred shapes.
- **Layout**: Three-panel Canvy-style editor (`#/studio`), responsive and mobile-first. TopNav and SiteFooter are hidden on `#/studio` for iframe embedding.
- **Iconography**: Inline SVG components.
- **Artwork Interaction**: Drag-to-move with automatic bounds checking, diagonal resize handle with smart scaling limits (70-130% for mockups, 30-300% for user photos). Artwork starts at true physical scale (based on 270cm wall height) and can be adjusted. Frame selector applies borders outside the artwork without shrinking it, maintaining physical frame thickness regardless of scale.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- **Routing**: Hash routing for landing page (`/`), editor (`#/studio`), authentication (`#/login`, `#/register`), dashboard (`#/dashboard`), and privacy policy (`#/privacy`).
- **Authentication System**:
    - **Backend API**: Express server with JWT authentication, cookie-based (HttpOnly cookies, 7-day expiration).
    - **User Roles**: user, artist, designer, gallery, admin (stored in PostgreSQL) with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    - **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, JWT tokens, CORS protection. Email confirmation is implemented but temporarily disabled for MVP. Password change functionality is available.
- **Studio Mode**:
    - **Left Panel (Scene Browser)**: Grid of 10 room preset thumbnails.
    - **Center Panel (Canvas)**: Displays selected room photo, supports user photo upload. Features real-scale rendering with artwork overlay, smart scaling limits, drag-to-move with bounds checking, and frame rendering that adds physical thickness borders outside the artwork. Wall recolor system is temporarily disabled.
    - **Right Panel (Controls)**: Artwork selector, real-size display (X × Y cm), frame selector (None/Slim/Gallery), reset position button.
- **Landing Page Components**: Includes TopNav, Hero section, How It Works, and SiteFooter.
- **Artwork Enrichment**: Automated script (`scripts/enrichArtworks.ts`) fetches product details and dimensions from Shopify, populating `src/data/artworks.json`.
- **Real-Scale Rendering**: Pixel-perfect artwork sizing based on physical dimensions (cm) and standardized room wall height (270cm).
- **Deployment**: Configured for Autoscale using `npm run build` and `npm start` with an Express server serving static files.
